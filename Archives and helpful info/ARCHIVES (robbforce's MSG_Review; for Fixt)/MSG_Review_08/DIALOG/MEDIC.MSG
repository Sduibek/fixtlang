{100}{}{I can't believe the things that you have done.}
{101}{}{I don't care. I'm hurt. Heal me.}
{102}{}{Hngh!}
{103}{}{No. I have taken a vow to not hurt life, but I will not help you.}
{104}{}{Lack of intelligence is no excuse for what you have done. Go away, I will not speak to you anymore.}
{105}{}{Oh my, you're seriously wounded. Here, let me help you.}
{106}{}{Welcome back, }
{107}{}{. How goes the search?}
{108}{}{It's going okay.}
{109}{}{I need help.}
{110}{}{Lol?}
{111}{}{Ah. Yes. Here, I found these. Try them when you need a boost.}
{112}{}{Good, keep up the good work. And let me know if you need anything.}
{113}{}{What can I do for you?}
{114}{}{I need healing.}
{115}{}{I need some drugs.}
{116}{}{I need some more stimpaks.}
{117}{}{Doh!}
{118}{}{Duh!}
{119}{}{I'm not authorized to give you any. Sorry.}
{120}{}{Thanks anyway.}
{121}{}{I have an urgent need for them. Without the drugs, the safety of the Vault is in jeopardy.}
{122}{}{Sorry, I can't give them to you.}
{123}{}{Well, since you put it that way. But don't tell anyone that I let you have these. They are extremely addictive and dangerous to use.}
{124}{}{Thanks.}
{125}{}{Stimpaks are being rationed. You are welcome to what we have in the medical container on the wall. Take as many as you need, but use them sparingly. It will be a while before we can get you some more.}
{126}{}{Hmm. Let's see if you are hurt.}
{127}{}{You seem okay to me. Come back if you need some healing.}
{128}{}{You look hurt. Here, let me help you.}
{129}{}{If you need healing, come back here to me or use some of the stimpaks we have. You can get more stimpaks from the wall.}
{130}{}{Lie down here, and we will start the healing process.}
{131}{}{You are fully healed. Take care of yourself in the future, but come back if you need any more healing. }
{132}{}{The medical scanners picked up some deadly radiation poisoning. Would you like us to attempt a healing? It will take a while.}
{133}{}{The medical scanners picked up some serious radiation poisoning. Would you like us to attempt a healing? It will take a while.}
{134}{}{The medical scanners picked up some major radiation poisoning. Would you like us to attempt a healing? It will take a while.}
{135}{}{The medical scanners picked up some mild radiation poisoning. Would you like us to attempt a healing? It will take a while.}
{136}{}{You see the Vault 13 medic.}
{137}{}{}
{138}{}{No.}
{139}{}{Okay, do it.}
{140}{}{How long?}
{141}{}{How long will it take, and how much radiation can you remove?}
{142}{}{Na.}
{143}{}{Ya.}
{144}{}{It's your body.}
{145}{}{It will take }
{146}{}{ minutes. Do you want to start the process?}
{147}{}{No.}
{148}{}{Yes.}
{149}{}{It will take }
{150}{}{ minutes. It will be able to remove about }
{151}{}{ percent. Do you want to start the process?}
{152}{}{No.}
{153}{}{Yes.}
{154}{}{This is going to be really, really painful.}
{155}{}{Okay, this shouldn't hurt at all.}
{156}{}{Okay, you should be feeling much better now. Be careful out there.}
{157}{}{I heard what you did, saving the Vault. Thank you.}
{158}{}{[More]}
{159}{}{The medic refuses to speak with you.}
{160}{}{Please don't do that.}
{161}{}{I've been poisoned!}
