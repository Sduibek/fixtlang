To play Fallout Fixt, grab a Nuka-Cola and click "Play Fallout Fixt" in your Fallout folder or "Fallout Fixt" in your Start Menu.

If your screen flickers or turns black during play, you should try running f1_screen_refresh.exe before playing the game. This is found in the Fallout Fixt folder.

***Steps to a pleasant experience in The Wasteland:***

1) While playing, make sure to SAVE OFTEN and USE ALL TEN SAVE SLOTS!

2) Take a look at the manual (MANUAL - English.pdf) and Quick Reference Card (KeyboardShortcuts.pdf) before playing.

3) If you experience issues such as psychedelic colors or the game not running at all, read Troubleshooting Fallout Fixt.txt and use the tools in the "Scrambled Colors Fixes" folder.

4) The Hi-Res mod by Mash now includes its own settings utility, "f1_res_Config.exe" - you'll find it in your Fallout Fixt folder. The settings can also be accessed through the in-game menus or by editing f1_res.ini

5) If you encounter issues, check the "Troubleshooting Fallout Fixt.txt" file.

Graphics are set to 800x600 @ 16bit by default with the included settings files, although you can change this of course, by editing f1_res.ini. [should be self-explanatory once you open the files for editing, but you can also get their readmes from the "Readmes (archived)" folder]

DirectX9/D3D mode from ddraw.ini doesn't like to play nice with f1_res. You can definitely play Fallout in this mode, but it may not run very well.
