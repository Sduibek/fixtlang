## NOTE: Each line in the description box holds roughly 40 characters in English. Meaning to add a blank line, add 40 spaces and then reduce as needed.
##       This will differ based on words used (since it wraps based on the word length)  --Sduibek, Fallout Fixt

## TRANSLATION NOTE: The long empty spaces below are intentional. Do not remove them. However, they will likely need to be modified after translation.
##                   The spaces are to create a nice-looking visual separation between the summaries and detailed stat-change descriptions.
##                   This means you will need to tweak the translation and number of spaces as needed, if you want to obtain the separation. (You don't have to, it's mostly cosmetic and to slightly increase readability)

{200}{}{Your metabolic rate is twice that of your fellow vault-dwellers. Because your body heals faster, it has not developed a normal resistance to the elements.                  +2 Healing Rate, but Poison Resistance & Radiation Resistance start at 0%}
{201}{}{A little slower, but a little bigger. You may not hit as often, but they will feel it when you do!                                                  +2 Strength, -2 Action Points.}
{202}{}{You are not quite as big as the other vault-dwellers, but that never slowed you down.                                               +1 Agility, but Carry Weight is lowered by 10 times your Strength.       (-10 lb at STR 1 up to -100 lb at STR 10)}
{203}{}{One of your hands is very dominant. You excel with 1-handed weapons.                  +20% Chance To Hit with all 1-handed weapons (including melee and unarmed), but -40% Chance To Hit with all 2-handed weapons.}
{204}{}{Your attacks show a lot of finesse. You cause more critical hits, but you don't do as much damage.                            +10% Critical Chance, but your attacks deal 30% less damage.}
{205}{}{By not paying any attention to threats, you can act a lot faster in a combat turn.                                     +5 Sequence, but Armor Class is 0 unless wearing armor.}
{206}{}{You swing harder, not better. Your attacks are very brutal, but lack finesse.            +4 Melee Damage, but  -30% to Critical Hits table (meaning damage boosts and other effects of Critical Hits are reduced and/or less likely).}
{207}{}{You attack faster than normal, so you don't have time to make targeted attacks.               All attacks (including melee and unarmed) cost 1 less Action Point, but you can't aim for specific body parts.}
{208}{}{By some strange twist of fate, people around you die very violently. You always see the worst way a person can die.       You never saw such violence in Vault life, so this may have unforseen effects on your future actions.}
{209}{}{Mayhem seems to follow you everywhere. Everyone around you has more critical failures in combat. The bad thing is, so do you!                All combat failures (misses) have a fairly high chance of being "upgraded" to a Critical Failure (critical miss).}
{210}{}{You spent more time than normal studying non-combative skills growing up.             +15% to First Aid, Doctor, Speech, and Barter, but -10% to Small Guns, Big Guns, Energy Weapons, Throwing, Melee Weapons, and Unarmed.}
{211}{}{You have enjoyed your trips to the vault medic a bit too much.                     You recover twice as fast as normal from the ill effects of drug addiction, but your chance to become addicted is also twice normal.}
{212}{}{You are resistant to all drugs and medications. This caused a lot of frustrations for the vault medic.                                               Your chance to become addicted to drugs is 50% of normal, but drugs only affect you half as long as normal.}
{213}{}{A night owl even as a child, you are more awake and alert when the sun goes down.                                                              +1 Intelligence and +1 Perception between 6:01 PM and 6:00 AM, but you have  -1 Intelligence and -1 Perception between 6:01 AM and 6:00 PM.}
{214}{}{You've spent more time honing your skills than most, because you were born with less potential than most.                    +10% to all skills and +5 Skill Points per level, but Perks only every 4th level. (Normal is every 3rd)}
{215}{}{You have more innate abilities and talents than most, so you have not spent as much time honing your skills.                                      +1 to all your primary statistics, but you start with -10% on all skills and receive 5 less Skill Points per level.}
