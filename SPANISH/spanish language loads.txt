+NOTES
 The "language" parameter should be either "spanish_female" or "spanish_male".
 Because of the way HDRP works, the original English ART files have to be replaced.
 The font files aren't language specific, so they need to be replaced. 
  These belong to the condensed UK version. The only files that change between
  versions (the only I'm aware of are condensed UK and US, and regular US) are
  FONT3.AAF and FONT4.AAF. For now on I'll only share those.
 Both folders in PREMADE have (and should have) the same files.

+TO-DO
We should let the user know they can change the gender in the installer.
We could even make a small graphic application that modifies the configuration
file, although this may be overkill.


"The simplest way before loading the game I can think of is to have both in folders called "SPANISH_MALE" and "SPANISH_FEMALE"
and changing either the variable in fallout.cfg (but I do not know if it only recognize some hardcoded languages or it looks for
the folder DATA/TEXT/$language) to point to the desired one as language, or moving the "SPANISH_$GENRE" to "SPANISH" (I say moving 
because it is faster). The latter, although I'm sure it would work, would require a few checks to know that you are not erasing any.
I think the easiest way would be to first check SPANISH alone, then if both genres ones are there, save the original as SPANISH_BAK 
and then rename the appropriate one to SPANISH. If SPANISH exists and one of the genres is missing, it assumes the genre missing is
the one loaded, and acts in consequence. If SPANISH doesn't exist, it just looks for the desired genre and moves (rename) it."
