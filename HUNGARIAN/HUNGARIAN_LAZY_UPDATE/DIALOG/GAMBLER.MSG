{100}{}{You see a seedy-looking Mexican man with slick hair.}
{101}{}{You see Hernandez, the rascally gambler.}
{102}{}{Oye, muchacho, allow me to introduce myself. I am Hernandez, a man of mucho gusto! You look like you are new here. Please, allow me to be your informant to the casino.}
{103}{}{Can you tell me about the casino?}
{104}{}{No, thanks.}
{105}{}{Bloo?}
{106}{}{But of course! This fine establishment is run by the famous Gizmo. A true visionary and a very wealthy man.}
{107}{}{Thanks.}
{108}{}{You say Gizmo is a visionary. What's his vision?}
{109}{}{What are the odds like on the games here?}
{110}{}{My friend, I hate to impose, but perhaps you could assist me. I have developed a sure-fire system, because I have discovered how Gizmo runs his tables, but I do not have the caps to play.}
{111}{}{ [You get the feeling that he's trying to scam you.]}
{112}{}{Perhaps you can spare a few caps? I guarantee success.}
{113}{}{Sure, sounds good.}
{114}{}{No, thanks.}
{115}{}{I think you're lying. You're trying to scam me.}
{116}{}{Sorry, mi amigo. Hey, let me show you a neat game . . .}
{117}{}{Thank you very much, mi amigo! In a few days I shall be ableto pay you back, with interest. My system is slow, you see, it requires much patience, but it will most certainly reap great profits!}
{118}{}{Very well, but I guarantee success! If you want to get in on the riches just waiting, come back soon, or I will find another partner!}
{119}{}{My friend, I see you are a man of much taste, as well. Perhaps a simple game of dice?}
{120}{}{Alright!}
{121}{}{No, thanks, I'd rather try something else.}
{122}{}{Gizmo had a dream of setting up a place where people could meet and enjoy themselves. He had the ambition to make it happen. The result is the casino you see here.}
{123}{}{He gives people a chance to shrug off their cares in the broken world outside. And he brings money into Junktown!}
{124}{}{Sounds like a good idea.}
{125}{}{Life's hard enough. I don't trust the motives of someone who would encourage people to lose their money.}
{126}{}{You obviously don't share Gizmo's brilliance. This place is a respite from the harshness of everyday life.}
{127}{}{Well, Gizmo runs a pretty good house, although the games are, how shall we say, rather weighted towards the house. It's not like his dealers cheat, though. But unless you have a system, like me, you will need to be very clever.}
{128}{}{Kösz.}
{129}{}{}
{130}{}{How is your system coming?}
{131}{}{Semmit, kösz.}
{132}{}{My system is developing slowly. I have living expenses and such, you know, but it is working!}
{133}{}{Ez remekül hangzik!}
{134}{}{Szerintem te egy hazug csaló vagy. Hol van a pénzem?}
{135}{}{So, you think you have tumbled to me, eh? Well, you won't get anything from me!}
