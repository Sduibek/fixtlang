# "Izo" is used here instead of "He" because there's no other context during the dialog; just these lines at the initiation of dialog window.
{102}{}{(Izo gives you your money)}
{103}{}{(Izo motions to the door, makes a throat-cutting gesture, and shakes his head.)}
{104}{}{Thanks.}
{105}{}{Duhh...}
{106}{}{(Izo motions to the door.)}
