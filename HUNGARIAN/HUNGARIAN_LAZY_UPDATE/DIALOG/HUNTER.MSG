# Chris Avellone is a male bounty hunter. He has an abrupt attitude and is serious about
# his money. He does not like child killers (which is the only way the player will meet him).

{100}{}{Egy nagy darab fejvadászt látsz, rajta cimke: "Christopher vagyok, és neked annyi."}
# Bounty Hunter is considered Male term

{101}{}{Mit akarsz?}
{102}{}{A doughnut.}
{103}{}{Mit csinálsz te itt?}
{104}{}{Csak kutakodok errefelé.}
{105}{}{Semmit.}
{106}{}{Nem szeretjük itt az okostojásokat. Lépj olajra, de gyorsan!}
# Alternate for "Buzz off" could be "Get lost" or "Get out of here"

{107}{}{Ez a vicc még elsõre sem jön be. Most rövidesen megtudod, hogy miért engem tartanak a pusztaság legfélelmetesebb fejvadászának. És még pénzt sem kapok érte...}
{108}{}{Semmi közöd hozzá!}
{109}{}{Jó, akkor kutakodj máshol!}
# Alternate for "poke around" could be "Look around"

{110}{}{Did you know that there's a bounty of }
{200}{}{ caps on your head for killing children? Time to collect!}
# Children is considered male plural

{111}{}{(He looks you over, carefully, considering something. It seems he's made a decision already.) Tell me, how often do you visit the Hub or Junktown?}
{112}{}{Often enough, why do you ask?}
{113}{}{Well, you see... business takes almost all of my time and I don't have an opportunity to get there. And as an incurable smoker I miss an old Zippo lighter very much. It's said, many of those pre-War items can be found in the shops there. If you get a Zippo for me, I'll share some information about the neighboring settlements. I think it could be of use!}
{114}{}{It's a pity. Looks like I made a mistake about you. Get out of here.}
{115}{}{Sure, why not? I'll get one for you.}
{116}{}{Okay.}
{117}{}{Hey, I have one right here. I don't really need it and can give it to you in exchange for the information.}
{118}{}{Thank you! (He takes the lighter.) So, what do you want to hear, exactly?}
{119}{}{Here is your lighter. Time to give me some information.}
{120}{}{No more questions, thanks.}
{121}{}{[More]}
{122}{}{What else do you want to know?}
{123}{}{I need some information.}
{124}{}{Buuhhh.. Wuh?}
{125}{}{Are you serious? Get out of my sight.}
{126}{}{I'm going to do the world a favor by putting a bullet through your skull.}
