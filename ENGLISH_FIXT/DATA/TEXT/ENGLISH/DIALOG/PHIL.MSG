{100}{}{You see a scared, angry peasant.}
{101}{}{You see: Phil.}
{102}{}{It ain't my dog!}
{103}{}{Damn right, kill that beast!}
{104}{}{I wouldn't trust that monster, if I were you. That thing is a genuine killer.}
{105}{}{Mister,}
{106}{}{Ma'am,}
{107}{}{ I would be really happy if you were to get rid of that damn dog.}
{108}{}{Why?}
{109}{}{Nah, I only deal with important stuff.}
{110}{}{Where did it come from?}
{111}{}{Hnnng.}
{112}{}{Oh geez. Maybe you can talk it to death?}
{113}{}{It won't let us back into our house, that's why.}
{114}{}{Got it, thanks.}
{115}{}{Isn't it your dog?}
{116}{}{It was the "pet" of a traveler. When the traveler died, this stupid dog just plopped its furry ass down on my doorstep and wouldn't leave. It's been there for days.}
{117}{}{Oh. Thanks!}
{118}{}{Who was this traveler?}
{119}{}{What did the traveler look like?}
{120}{}{I don't know. Some guy. He came from the east, he said. Like anyone could get past the deadlands to the east. He ran afoul of Gizmo, trying to interfere with Gizmo's business.}
{121}{}{So, Gizmo had a couple of boys beat him up and throw him from the casino roof. The traveler broke his damnfool neck and died. The dog was pissed.}
{122}{}{What did the traveler look like?}
{123}{}{Oh, the guy was tall, dark-haired with a little graying around the edges. He was dressed all in black leather, like that's a good idea in the desert; and carried a shotgun.}
{124}{}{He had some funny accent. The dog was his constant companion; followed him everywhere.}
{125}{}{Appreciate the info!}
{126}{}{I really hate this stupid dog.}
{127}{}{Thanks for your help, stranger.}
{128}{}{Wow, okay. See you around I guess. Asshole.}
