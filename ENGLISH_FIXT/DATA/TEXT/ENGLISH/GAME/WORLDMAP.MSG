# 500 is hard-coded to be generated automatically by engine, displayed in messagebox.
# Weirdly it's not always generated though.
#
# That is why its phrasing was changed for Fixt; it has been replaced by lines 
# 700, 701, 702 from GENCHAT.MSG so if the engine decides to display this one, it still works.
