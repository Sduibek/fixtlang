Changes since 0.80alpha:

INSTALLATION
 - Fallout Fixt now installs in a subfolder titled "Fallout Fixt" of where you tell it to install. (Thanks Lexx!)
  -- This means you won't overwrite anything from your current Fallout installation. Hooray!
  -- You still need to select your current Fallout folder as the install directory, because Fixt needs to know where to find the main data files.

 - Fallout Fixt installer no longer backs up savegames during install. This was causing issues on some systems.
  -- The silver lining is that since it's being installed in a subfolder now, your original savegames will stay untouched regardless.

FIXED
 - Fixed crash when giving holodisk to Jon Zimmerman.
 - Razor no longer dissapears forever.
 - Fixed crash moving items between containers in inventory. (Thanks Crafty!)
 - Talius' dialog options regarding the spy are now available as they should have been.
 - No more broken Start Menu links.
 - Display of title and/or level on levelup now works properly on Fixes Only installs.

REVERTED
 - "Free combat running fix" in Sfall now disabled by default as it caused confusing functionality.

EDITED
 - Updated troubleshooting guide, and added index to top of file.
 - URLs for Troubleshooting Guide and Changelog now open the file directly as a download rather than with Dropbox's file viewer.
 - More text & dialog changes/fixes. 200+ files modified. (Thanks robbforce!)
