============================================================================
First, make sure you're using the most current version of Fallout Fixt:
============================================================================
www.nma-fallout.com/showthread.php?194562&p=3818107&viewfull=1#post3818107

You can confirm your version by viewing Credits (press "C") from the game's main menu.


============================================================================
Troubleshooting specific crashes:
============================================================================
- Crashes after damaging someone with explosives?

0) This is a limitation in the Fallout engine that I can't fix, but there's workarounds. (It's fixed in the Fallout 2 engine by modders)
1) First, see if you can kill them with one blast, and stay on the map when the blast goes off. That should avoid this whole issue.
2) If you get attacked by whomever the explosives damaged after it detonates, try again because you're going to get a crash. If combat didn't engage, you're good.
3) IMPORTANT NOTE: With either of the options below, once you return to the map you must enter a combat round (press "A") and then end the combat round (press "Enter") so that the engine can clear combat variables. This is why the crashes happen to begin with; uncleared combat variables related to the explosion damage.
4) Option 1: Set timer for the explosives from your active hand. This means inventory is closed. When you click the explosives and set the timer, it'll drop to your feet automatically. Leave the map before the explosives detonate. (See #6 for a note about leaving the map)
5) Option 2: Set timer from inventory but DO NOT DROP the explosives. Exit inventory, then plant the explosives on your target using Steal. Leave the map before the explosives detonate. (See #6 for a note about leaving the map)
6) Leaving the map before the explosives detonate isn't without its downsides. The script flags might not trigger when leaving the map this way, meaning the game might not register these people as actually dead, for the purposes of quests and such.

- Crashes when giving the holodisk to Jon in Adytum/Boneyard?

0) The location of the disk doesn't matter. It could be on the ground, in a party member's inventory, etc.
1) Interact with the holodisk in any way. The easiest is to hover the mouse over it, so that you get the "You see: Regulator Transmissions Disk" message.
2) Try to show him the disk again via dialog; it shouldn't crash now.

- Crashes trying to join the Brotherhood of Steel by giving Cabbot the holodisk?

0) The location of the disk doesn't matter. It could be on the ground, in a party member's inventory, etc.
1) Interact with the holodisk in any way. The easiest is to hover the mouse over it, so that you get the "You see: Ancient Brotherhood Disk" message.
2) Try again; it shouldn't crash now.

- Crashes trying to leave the Brotherhood of Steel?

0) Ensure that Fallout Fixt is not currently running.
1) You will need to replace BROHDENT.SAV in the crashing savegame's folder with a known non-crashing copy.
2) For example if slot 5 is crashing but slot 4 isn't, go into {Fallout Fixt}\DATA\SAVEGAME\SLOT04 and copy BROHDENT.SAV, then paste it into {Fallout Fixt}\DATA\SAVEGAME\SLOT05
3) Select "Yes" when prompted to overwrite the file.
4) You might have to also do the holodisk fix described above! (Interacting with the item such as examining it)
5) Try again; it shouldn't crash now.

- Crashes trying to leave a Random Encounter on the worldmap? (Desert, Mountains, City, Coast)

0) The cause of this crash is currently unknown.
1) Open up PIP-Boy 2000 and rest for 10 minutes.
2) Try again to leave the map.
3) If that doesn't work, reload the save and try starting a combat round (press "A") and then press "Enter" to end combat.
4) Try again to leave the map.
5) If still crashing, try a combination of these steps.

- Crashes trying to leave any other map?

Follow same steps as crashes trying to leave a Random Encounter map.


============================================================================
The game is still crashing! :(
============================================================================
1) Double-check that you have the most current version - see the top of this file for link.
2) Submit a detailed bug report for the issue to:  http://falloutmods.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_Fixt_bug_reports
3) With the bug report, make sure to include your affected savegames! I need savegames to test the issue.
4) [optional] Send a message to Sduibek and tell him that he sucks for breaking the game. This won't fix the crash, but it can be cathartic.
5) Crashes can sometimes be fixed by replacing map files from working savegames. See the "Crashes trying to leave the Brotherhood of Steel?" subsection above. FOR A LIST OF MAP NAMES, SEE THE BOTTOM OF THIS DOCUMENT.
6) Sduibek will cry and feel terrible for breaking the game :(


===============================================================================
I can't get good slideshow endings for The Hub or The Followers Of The Apocalypse!
===============================================================================
- Assuming you have Fallout Fixt alpha 7.0 or newer, here are the requirements:
THE HUB: Harold is alive, Decker is dead.
FOLLOWERS: Nicole is alive, Spy quest finished, at least 12 Followers members alive (not including Katja & Nicole).

- These endings ARE possible to get with characters from previous versions of Fixt, but you have to do this first:
The Hub: visit Oldtown.
Followers: visit the Followers map.


===============================================================================
Something bad happened and I lost a bunch of progress since my last save! >:(
===============================================================================
- Next time, save often and use all 10 save slots!
- Pay attention to the Fallout Fixt installer that says to save often.
- Save often.
- If needed, back up your 10 save slots periodically.
- Use all 10 save slots.
- Read the Fallout manual PDF where it says to save often.


==========================================
== There's no sound during the movies!  ==
==========================================
Make sure you have the volume turned on: in game, Music and Movie volume are on the same slider.


====================================================================================
== On startup, fallout crashes with a 'Failure initializing input devices' error. ==
====================================================================================
In ddraw.ini, in the [input] section, change BackgroundKeyboard to 1 and see if that fixes the error. If it doesn't, try just changing BackgroundMouse to 1. If that doesn't help, change both to 1. Remember to change back to 0 if it causes any issues.
Also, this errors sometimes happens if you select another window/application or switch to another window/application just as Fallout is loading. Make sure once you start FalloutW.exe, you don't click anything or hit any buttons until you see the "Interplay" movie begin.
In some rare cases, you may need to engage Compatibility Mode for FalloutW.exe - rightclick on the exe, click on the Compatability tab, and try running with the following modes, in this order until the error stops: Windows XP mode, Windows 98 mode, Windows 95 mode. You can also try the other Compatability checkboxes but the Operating System mode is the most important.


===============================================
== Black screens/psychedelic color schemes. ==
===============================================
Make sure f1_res is enabled.
If you don't want to use f1_res or can't use it, and you're using Windows Vista or newer, run the applications in the Scrambled Colors Fixes folder. You can point these to FalloutW.exe and **follow the utility's instructions exactly** and it should fix all these display issues.
In some rare cases, you may need to actually use ddraw.ini settings; change to Mode 4 or Mode 5. This is not advised unless you have exhausted all other options AND are not using f1_res.


==========================================================================================================
== Fallout refuses to run, displaying the message 'Fallout appears to be running in compatibility mode' ==
==========================================================================================================
Sometimes sfall (ddraw) doesn't play nicely with any compatibility mode settings, so it refuses to run with them turned on. Turn them all off. Do this by right clicking fallout2.exe, switching to the compatibility tab and unchecking everything.


=========================================================================
== A crash on startup mentioning a missing entry point in kernel32.dll ==
=========================================================================
sfall (ddraw) requires Windows XP or newer.


========================================================================================================
== fallout crashes on startup with errors about DirectX not being installed, or DirectX files missing ==
========================================================================================================
Download and run the full DirectX package from this page:

http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=8109


==============================================================================================================
== fallout crashes on startup with errors about missing dll files NOT related to DirectX (mvcrp60.dll, etc) ==
==============================================================================================================
Install the MVB Runtime Distributables in this order, **trying to run Fallout again after installing each**:
(you shouldn't need versions 2010 and 2012 but they're listed here just in case)

=============================================================================
== Cannot edit ddraw.ini, or ddraw.ini edits don't seem to have any effect ==
=============================================================================
If you're on vista, windows 7 or newer and have UAC enabled, then do _not_ install Fallout Fixt to the Program Files directory.
Instead pick a path like 'C:\Games\Fallout'. The Program Files directory is protected by windows, and you'll find yourself either unable to modify the files in it, or your files will end up getting mixed with copies in the virtualstore.

*NOTE: This shouldn't apply to the Steam and GOG versions, they seem to play nice with UAC somehow.


============================================================================
"Could not find the master datafile. Please make sure the FALLOUT CD is in
 the drive and that you are running FALLOUT from the directory you installed it to." 
============================================================================
- Make sure you're running from the proper directory
- Make sure you installed Fixt directly on top of an existing Fallout installation
- Make sure master.dat and critter.dat are in that directory
- Make sure Fixt is NOT installed under C:\Program Files\Fallout or C:\Program Files (x86)\Fallout
- Try running directly: just FalloutW.exe, instead of batch file or using Steam interface.


============================================================================
Graphics issues
============================================================================
- Use the tools and read the file in the "Scrambled Colors Fixes" folder (if folder exists)
- Try the Compatibility Mode settings: (right-click on FalloutW.exe, click Properties, and click on the Compatibility tab)
--  Try setting to Run As Administrator
--  Try setting Compatibility Mode to Windows 95 and then Windows 98 modes
- Disable and then re-Enable the f1_res (option in f1_res_Config)
- Make sure Fixt is NOT installed under C:\Program Files\Fallout or C:\Program Files (x86)\Fallout
- Try new settings in ddraw.ini and/or f1res.ini - try 16bit, 8bit, and any other settings that look like they might apply to your situation.
- Set your desktop background to a solid color (instead of a picture)
- Open the Screen Resolution settings for your computer under Display Settings in Control Panel and leave it open while playing
- Kill explorer.exe process, play Fallout, then re-start explorer.exe process. An example batch file is in Scrambled Colors Fixes folder.


============================================================================
Armor-Piercing ammo sucks!
============================================================================
- Nothing can be done about this at the moment. Once I release Fixt in the
  Fallout 2 engine, this will no longer be an issue.


============================================================================
Issues with mouse input - slow, doesn't respond, crashes, etc.
============================================================================
- Change the BackgroundMouse and BackgroundKeyboard settings in ddraw.ini (try setting them to 1 individually, and then both to 1)
- Try alternate mouse input mode in f1_res.ini
- If that doesn't help, try disabling ddraw (temporarily removing ddraw.ini and ddraw.dll from Fallout Fixt folder)
- If that doesn't help, try disabling f1_res (click Disable in the Config.exe, and then temporarily move f1_res.dll and f1_res.ini from Fallout Fixt folder)


============================================================================
I can't push my companions!
============================================================================
- Unlike Fallout 2, this must be done via dialog. There is no UI option for it.
  Talk to your companion(s) and you'll see the option to push them.
  This will be a non-issue once Fixt is ported to the Fallout 2 engine.


============================================================================
The game runs too fast or too slow!
============================================================================
- Change the value of SpeedMultiInitial in ddraw.ini in the Fallout folder.
- Sduibek plays at 115%  (SpeedMultiInitial=115)
* IMPORTANT: This can cause issues with the endgame slideshow; see below.


============================================================================
In the endgame slideshow, Ron Perlman's voice is getting cut off!
============================================================================
- Change the value of SpeedMultiInitial in ddraw.ini to 104 or less.
--  ("SpeedMultiInitial=104" without quotes)
- Try 100 if 104 doesn't work.


============================================================================
Only male graphics are displayed for the Vault Dweller, even if I'm female
============================================================================
- This is a bug caused by pirated or corrupted critter.dat file

1) Acquire a valid Fallout version, such as from CD-ROM or Steam or GOG
2) Reinstall from that version, or, simply copy over the critter.dat


============================================================================
There is a black box, size 640x480, covering the screen!
============================================================================
- We think this is caused by pirated or corrupted master.dat/critter.dat
- HOWEVER, updating to newest f1_res fixes this issue.

1) Fallout Fixt includes newest f1_res
2) If you're still somehow experiencing this issue, download and install newest f1_res from:
