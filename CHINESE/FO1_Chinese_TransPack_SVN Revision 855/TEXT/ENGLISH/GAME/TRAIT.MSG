#   TRAIT DESCRIPTIONS
#
#{200}{}{Your metabolic rate is twice normal.  This means that you are much less resistant to radiation and poison, but your body heals faster.}
#{201}{}{A little slower, but a little bigger.  You may not hit as often, but they will feel it when you do!  Your total action points are lowered, but your Strength is increased.}
#{202}{}{You are not quite as big as the other Vault-Dwellers, but that never slowed you down.  You can't carry as much, but you are more agile.}
#{203}{}{One of your hands is very dominant.  You excel with single-handed weapons, but two-handed weapons cause a problem.}
#{204}{}{Your attacks show a lot of finesse.  You don't do as much damage, but you cause more critical hits.}
#{205}{}{By not paying attention to any threats, you can act a lot faster in a turn.  This lowers your armor class to just what you are wearing, but you sequence much faster in a combat turn.}
#{206}{}{You swing harder, not better.  Your attacks are very brutal, but lack finesse.  You rarely cause a good critical, but you always do more melee damage.}
#{207}{}{You don't have time to aim for a targeted attack, because you attack faster than normal people.  It costs you one less action point to use a weapon.}
#{208}{}{By some strange twist of fate, people around you die violently.  You always see the worst way a person can die.}
#{209}{}{The good thing is that everyone around you has more critical failures in combat, the bad thing is so do you!}
#{210}{}{You studied less-combative skills as you were growing up.  Your combat skills start at a lower level, but First Aid, Doctor, Speech and Barter are substantially improved.}
#{211}{}{You are more easily addicted to chems.  Your chance to be addicted by chem use is twice normal, but you recover faster from their ill effects.}
#{212}{}{Chems only affect you half as long as normal, but your chance to be addicted is also only 50% of normal.}
#{213}{}{As a night-time person, you are more awake when the sun goes down.  Your Intelligence and Perception are improved at night, but dulled during the day.}
#{214}{}{Since you spent more time improving your skills than a normal person, you start with better skill levels.  The tradeoff is that you do not gain as many extra abilities.  You will gain a perk every four levels.}
#{215}{}{You have more innate abilities than most, so you have not spent as much time honing your skills.  Your primary statistics are each +1, but you lose -10% on all skills to start, and receive 5 less skill points per level.}
{200}{}{你的新陈代谢是别人的两倍。这代表着你对放射线以及毒的防御力较低，但是你的伤恢复的较快。}
{201}{}{你的动作很慢，但身体强壮。在战斗时也许攻击次数比较少，但是每一次攻击会造成相当大的伤害。你的最高行动点数会比较低，你的力量会比较高。}
{202}{}{你比别人要小一号，但动作要比别人快。你无法负荷很重的重量，但你的灵活度会比较高。}
{203}{}{你的一只手臂比另一只要发达许多，因此你对于单手使用的武器相当在行，不过双手使用的武器则会对你造成一些困扰。}
{204}{}{你的普通攻击造成的伤害并不多，但你可以时常的使出特别攻击，造成相当大的伤害。}
{205}{}{你对周围的危险全然不在乎，所以你的动作相当快。因此你的防御点数只有你身上装甲所提供的防御点数，不过在战斗中通常都会由你先攻。}
{206}{}{你的手臂相当强壮，却不够灵活。在攻击时可以造成相当大的伤害，但是却不能经常使出特别攻击。}
{207}{}{你开枪的速度很快，但不能瞄准特殊的部位。在使用枪和空投武器时所用的行动点数会比正常人少一个点。}
{208}{}{不知道为什么，如果你遇到的人会死，他们总会以最惨的方式死去。你总是会看到他人惨死的景象。}
{209}{}{好消息是：你遇到的敌人无论对你使用什么样的攻击都不容易成功。坏消息是：你也一样！}
{210}{}{小时候你并没有学习过很多有关战斗的技巧，因此你的战斗力一开始会比较差。不过医疗技术、急救、演说能力以及杀价能力都会以相当快的速度进步。}
{211}{}{你比别人更容易对一种化学药品上瘾，但是你受化学药品影响的时间也比别人要短。}
{212}{}{你对化学药品上瘾的几率是别人的50%，但是你受化学药品影响的时间却是别人的两倍。}
{213}{}{作为喜欢晚上四处活动的人，你在夜里是非常清醒的。当太阳落山后你的感知力和智力会有所提升，但在白天你却显的比较迟钝。}
{214}{}{你花相当长的时间来学习一项技术，所以每次升级后你都会多得到五个技能点数，但是你每升四级后才能得到新的特别技能。}
{215}{}{你有很高的天赋，但是你却不够细心。一开始，你的每一项数值都会比别人多一个点，但是你所有的技能都会比别人少5%，同时，每次升级你都会少得到5个技能点数。}
