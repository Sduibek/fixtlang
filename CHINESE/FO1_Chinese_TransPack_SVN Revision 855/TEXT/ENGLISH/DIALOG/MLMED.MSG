# {100}{}{You see two super mutants. One looks hurt, and the other is tending him.}
# {101}{}{Well, how do you feel now?}
# {102}{}{【moves his shoulder】 Ah, it's still a little sore. At least the bleeding stopped.}
# {103}{}{Good, good. Keep using your medication and you should be good as new.}
# {104}{}{Excellent. When I get my hands on that little human, I'm going to crush him.}
# {105}{}{Excellent. When I get my hands on that little human, I'm going to crush her.}
# {106}{}{He sure did enough damage that last time. I hope they get him soon.}
# {107}{}{She did enough damage that last time. I hope they get her soon.}

{106}{}{他打得我很爽，我希望他们很快就能抓到他。}
{107}{}{她打得我很爽，我希望他们很快就能抓到她。}
{108}{}{想象一下，如果我们的全盘计划都毁灭了，而只是因为一个渺小的人类。}
{109}{}{【大笑】是啊，那真是丢人啊。}
{110}{}{【偷着笑】}
