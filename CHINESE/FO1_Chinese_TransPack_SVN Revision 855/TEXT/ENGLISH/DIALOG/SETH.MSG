#{100}{}{You see Seth, leader of the guards of Shady Sands.}
#{101}{}{You! You've plagued our village for long enough.
# I'll kill you myself!}
#{102}{}{Nothing good comes of your kind. I will kill you and
# rid the wasteland of one more monster.}
#{103}{}{Not very bright, eh? Well, watch out for the Radscorpions,
# and stay out of trouble.}
#{104}{}{Scorpin!}
#{105}{}{Bye-bye.}
#{106}{}{You look like one of those raiders. We keep a close watch
# here in Shady Sands. What do you want?}
#{107}{}{I want all of your money!}
#{108}{}{I'd like some information.}
#{109}{}{Bloop?}
#{110}{}{Good day. I am called Seth. How can I help you?}
#{111}{}{I'd like some information.}
#{112}{}{Wub-wub!}
#{113}{}{Information? What do you want to know about?}
#{114}{}{What can I do for you?}
#{115}{}{I want to know about the Radscorpions.}
#{116}{}{I want to know about the raiders.}
#{117}{}{I want to know about this place.}
#{118}{}{Take me to the Radscorpion caves.}
#{119}{}{Cave!}
#{120}{}{Nothing else, thanks.}
#{121}{}{What do you want now?}
#{122}{}{Those damn Radscorpions have been after our Brahmin since we moved here.
# Not a week goes by that someone doesn't get poisoned trying to keep them out of the
# pens. Last week they took my brother Jarvis. Razlo, our doctor, is looking for an
# antidote as quickly as he can. Hey, if you have the means to help us, why don't
# you talk to our leader, Aradesh.}
#{123}{}{There are several groups of raiders. I organize guards like Ian
# to help fight them off. There is one band to the southeast of here. Watch out for them.}
#{124}{}{Shady Sands is a peaceful community. We have our own irrigation
# system, so we can grow our own food. If we were not plagued
# with raiders and Radscorpions, we would have no problems.}
#{125}{}{Are you sure you want me to give you directions to the Radscorpion caves?  I can't go, but I can show you the way.}
#{126}{}{Yes.}
#{127}{}{No.}
#{128}{}{Ok, just let me know when you are ready to go to the caves.}
#{129}{}{【Done】}
#{130}{}{Uh-huh.}
{100}{}{你看见赛思，沙荫镇的门卫队长。}
{101}{}{你！你在这小镇惹的麻烦已经够多的了，我现在要亲手杀了你。}
{102}{}{我看你来者不善良。我会杀了你，从此又一个混蛋要从这废土上消失了。}
{103}{}{我看你没那么聪明，呃？好吧，小心那些大蝎子，别惹麻烦。}
{104}{}{蝎子！}
{105}{}{拜拜。}
{106}{}{你看上去象那些歹徒，我们在沙荫镇保持警戒，你想要什么？}
{107}{}{我要你所有的钱！}
{108}{}{我想要问一些问题！}
{109}{}{蠢货？}
{110}{}{你好，我叫赛思，我能帮你什么忙吗？}
{111}{}{我想问你一些问题！}
{112}{}{哇-哇！}
{113}{}{问题？你想知道什么？}
{114}{}{我能帮你什么忙吗？}
{115}{}{告诉我关于大蝎子的事。}
{116}{}{告诉我关于歹徒的事。}
{117}{}{我想要了解一下这个地方。}
{118}{}{带我去大蝎子的洞穴吧。}
{119}{}{洞穴！}
{120}{}{没什么，谢谢。}
{121}{}{你现在想要什么？}
{122}{}{那些可恶的大蝎子自我们搬到这来不久就出现了，那些没有被大蝎子蛰过人的都尽量远离它们。上周，我的兄弟贾维斯中了蝎子的毒，如果你有什么方法能帮我们的话，为什么不去和我们的镇长亚拉德什谈谈呢？}
{123}{}{那儿有好多歹徒，我组织了一些象伊恩那样的警卫和他们战斗。那些歹徒在南方有一个基地，你可要小心。}
{124}{}{沙荫镇是个宁静的地方，我们有自己的灌溉，能自己提供食物如果不是因为那些大蝎子和歹徒的骚扰，我们就不会有那么多麻烦。}
{125}{}{你真的要我带你去那个蝎子洞穴吗？我不想去那，但我可以给你指路。}
{126}{}{是。}
{127}{}{不。}
{128}{}{好吧，当你想去那洞穴的时候就告诉我一声。}
{129}{}{【完成】}
{130}{}{呃-喔。}
{131}{}{唔-唔。}
#{200}{}{Our entire town is grateful to you for destroying the
# radscorpions. Thank you.}
#{201}{}{Thanks to you, we are now safe from them.}
#{202}{}{Are you sure you want to return there? It is a long journey,
# and you have removed the threat of them.}
#{203}{}{Ok. Enjoy your stay here.}
#{204}{}{Welcome to Shady Sands, stranger. Please holster that weapon
# while you are here.}
#{205}{}{Hello stranger. Welcome to Shady Sands.}
#{206}{}{You should speak to Aradesh, our leader. He likes to meet
# all of our visitors. He should be in our Town Hall, the building
# to the south.}
{200}{}{我们全镇的人都向你表示感谢，谢谢你帮我们除掉了蝎子。谢谢！}
{201}{}{谢谢你，现在我们安全多了。}
{202}{}{你真的还想要去一趟吗？那还挺远的，而且你已经除去了隐患。}
{203}{}{好吧，祝你在这愉快。}
{204}{}{欢迎来到沙荫镇，陌生人。在这的时候请放下的武器。}
{205}{}{你好，陌生人。欢迎来到沙荫镇。}
{206}{}{你可以去和亚拉德什谈谈，我们的镇长。他非常欢迎任何来访者，他应该在镇政厅，南面的那幢建筑。}

#{300}{}{Thank Dharma you're here wanderer. My girl . . . uh, Tandi,
# Aradesh's daughter, has been kidnapped. We believe the raiders have her.}
#{301}{}{Where are these raiders?}
#{302}{}{Wow. Tough break. Well, I'll see you later.}
#{303}{}{I'm sorry, I wish I could help.}
#{304}{}{That's terrible, but I've got to take care of those
# radscorpions first. They pose a danger to your whole town.}
#{305}{}{Where's Tandi? Why haven't you rescued her?}
#{306}{}{I need more supplies before I can tackle those guys.}
#{307}{}{I decided the little tramp wasn't worth the risk.}
#{308}{}{I'm working on it.}
#{309}{}{I thought I'd take care of your radscorpion problem first.}
#{310}{}{I thought you were a good person. So be it.}
#{311}{}{They're to the southeast. Please, hurry. I don't know what they'll do to her.}
#{312}{}{Okay, I'll get her back for you.}
#{313}{}{I didn't say I'd help, I've got my own problems to worry about.}
#{314}{}{How much is this job worth to you?}
#{315}{}{I've got to help my own people. I'm sorry.}
#{316}{}{I knew you were a heartless mercenary. We'll pay you well for saving her,
# rest assured.}
#{317}{}{If you're not going to tell me how much you'll give me, I'm not going
# to take the job.}
#{318}{}{Alright, I'll take care of it for you.}
#{319}{}{Sorry, I've got to go.}
#{320}{}{You bastard!}
#{321}{}{Please hurry. Only the gods know what they are doing to her.}
#{322}{}{I wish you'd save Tandi first, stranger, but, if you're willing to help us
# with the radscorpions, I guess I'll show you the way.}
#{323}{}{Okay, take me to the radscorpions.}
#{324}{}{I changed my mind. Good bye.}
#{325}{}{Great. I'll be back in a while, and you can take me then.}
{300}{}{你能在这真是太好了，我的女孩……呃，坦蒂，亚拉德什镇长的女儿，被绑架了，我相信那一定是那伙歹徒干的。}
{301}{}{那些歹徒在哪？}
{302}{}{哇，真倒霉。好吧，我们待会见。}
{303}{}{对不起，我希望我能帮你。}
{304}{}{那真糟糕，但我要先帮你解决那些大蝎子，它们对你们村庄威胁很大。}
{305}{}{坦蒂在哪？为什么你没有去救她？}
{306}{}{我需要更多的装备才能干掉那些混蛋。}
{307}{}{我觉得那个一点不值得冒险。}
{308}{}{我正在努力。}
{309}{}{我觉得应该先解决那些大蝎子的隐患。}
{310}{}{我觉得你这人很不错，的确不错。}
{311}{}{他们在南面，请快点，我不知道他们会对她做些什么。}
{312}{}{好的，我会把她带回来的。}
{313}{}{我可没说我要帮忙，我自己还有许多事情要处理呢。}
{314}{}{要看这工作值多少钱？}
{315}{}{我必须要帮助自己的人民，对不起。}
{316}{}{你真是个没良心的吝啬鬼，好吧，如果你救了他，我们会付你钱的。}
{317}{}{如果不告诉我你愿意给多少钱，我可不愿意帮忙干这个。}
{318}{}{好吧，我会为你留意的。}
{319}{}{对不起，我得走了。}
{320}{}{你这垃圾！}
{321}{}{请快点。真担心不知道他们会对她做出什么事情来。}
{322}{}{陌生人，我希望你先救救坦蒂，如果你想帮我们解决大蝎子的隐患，我也会给你带路。}
{323}{}{好吧，带我去看看那些蝎子。}
{324}{}{我改变主意了，再见。}
{325}{}{好吧。我一会儿会回来的，你等着我。}
