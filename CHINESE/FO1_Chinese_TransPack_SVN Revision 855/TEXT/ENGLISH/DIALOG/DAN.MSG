{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see Dan.}
{100}{}{你看到了丹。}
#{101}{}{Help!}
{101}{}{救命！}
#{102}{}{Why hello there, m'friend and welcome to the Hub. Let me introduce m'self,
# they call me 'Dan The Brahmin Man!' I wheel and deal with all the merchants
# around here, offer'n my humble services for a low, low price. So now, what
# can I do ya' for. }
{102}{}{嘿朋友，欢迎来哈勃城。先做个自我介绍，他们都叫我双头牛丹。我跟商人们打交道，也为他们跑跑腿。通常情况下，鄙人服务的开价是非常，非常低廉的。您有什么需要么？}
#{103}{}{young man?}
{103}{}{年轻人？}
#{104}{}{my man?}
{104}{}{这位先生？}
#{105}{}{my little lady?}
{105}{}{这位女士？}
#{106}{}{I want to join a caravan.}
{106}{}{我想加入商队。}
#{107}{}{Uh, what services do you offer, exactly?}
{107}{}{呃，你到底能提供哪些服务啊？}
#{108}{}{Why the hell are you yelling at that poor kid?!}
{108}{}{你干嘛老冲着那个可怜的小毛孩大喊大叫？！}
#{109}{}{Urg.}
{109}{}{呃。}
#{110}{}{Why, I manage the care for perddy much all of the Caravan's wagons
# and Brahmin in these parts. If they ever need anything for their caravans,
# I'm the one they talk to. Hell, the Big Three deal with me exclusively.}
{110}{}{这样说吧，这些地方大多数的商队的马车啊，双头牛什么的，都是归我来照管的。要是他们想为他们的商队里添点什么东西的话，也会和我打交道。可是，妈的，三巨头他们不带我玩。}
#{111}{}{Who are the Big Three?}
{111}{}{三巨头是谁？}
#{112}{}{Well aren't you important.}
{112}{}{看来你是个重要的人嘛。}
#{113}{}{Really? That's nice. I want to join a caravan.}
{113}{}{真的？太棒了？我也要加入商队。}
#{114}{}{Well, I got to go. Bye.}
{114}{}{嗯，我得走了，拜拜。}
#{115}{}{What?  Get the hell out of here ya damn Skag! Ta think I was about
# to waist m'time on a low-life like yerself.}
{115}{}{什么？赶快给我滚出去吧，你这个瘾君子！我可不想在你这个低能儿身上浪费时间。}
#{118}{}{Damn, son.  Have ya' been locked up all yer life in a cave or somethin'? The Big Three are the three largest
# Merchant groups in the world. Well, okay, maybe not the world, but they sure as hell cover a large portion;
# 'bout as far as yer eye can see.}
{118}{}{该死，小子，你是不是一直生活在个什么洞里面啊？三巨头就是这个世界，嗯，也许不是全世界，但是绝对是你能想象到的最大的那么一大块地方上最大的三个商队。}
#{119}{}{Damn, honey.  Have ya' been locked up all yer life in a cave or somethin'? The Big Three are the three largest
# Merchant groups in the world. Well, okay, maybe not the world, but they sure as hell cover a large portion;
# 'bout as far as yer eye can see.}
{119}{}{该死，亲爱的，你是不是一直生活在个什么洞里面啊？三巨头就是这个世界，嗯，也许不是全世界，但是绝对是你能想象到的最大的那么一大块地方上最大的三个商队。}
#{120}{}{Damn yourself, you brahmin freak.}
{120}{}{你才该死，你这个双头牛怪物。}
#{121}{}{Oh, them. I thought you were talking about something else. So how do I join a caravan?}
{121}{}{哦，是他们啊。我还以为你在说别的什么东西呐。我怎么才能加入一支商队？}
#{122}{}{Okay, thanks. Bye.}
{122}{}{好的，谢谢。拜拜。}
#{123}{}{Bramin freak? Is that an attempt at insult'n me? I would be a little more polite to the people ya' meet,
# stranger. I could care less, but this city is filled with all sorts of cutthroats that wouldn't hesitate to
# slit yer throat if ya look at'm wrong.}
{123}{}{双头牛怪物？你不是在侮辱我吧？告诉你吧，陌生人，我会比你要见到的人更懂礼貌。我可以不那么在意，可是，在这个城市里，到处都是些杀手恶汉，他们要是看你不爽，二话不说就会把你的喉咙给割咯。}
#{124}{}{Damn, you're one ugly son of a bitch!}
{124}{}{混蛋，你这个丑八怪杂种！}
#{125}{}{I'm scared. See ya.}
{125}{}{我好怕哦。回见。}
#{126}{}{Special, no. Lucky, yes; and unless ya want to be unlucky you'll be a little more polite to the people ya'
# meet. I could care less, but this city is filled with all sorts of cutthroats that wouldn't hesitate to slit
# yer throat if ya' look at'm wrong.}
{126}{}{特别，不。幸运，是的。除非你想自触霉头，你就得对你见到的人表现得礼貌一点。我可以不那么在意，可是，在这个城市里，到处都是些杀手恶汉，他们要是看你不爽，二话不说就会把你的喉咙给割了。}
#{127}{}{Damn, you're one ugly son of a bitch!}
{127}{}{放屁！你个王八H的！}
#{128}{}{If you say so.}
{128}{}{要是你这样说的话……}
#{129}{}{Well at least I don't have a mutated hind for a face.  Yer mother must have been a brahmin and yer
# daddy a rat; that's the only way ya' could have come out so damn ugly.  Hell, yer uglier than me!}
{129}{}{我至少没有像变种人那样的猪头脸。你妈一定是头双头牛，你爸是只耗子，所以才生出你这个鸟样儿。妈的，你比我丑多了！}
#{130}{}{No one talks about my mother like that!  Prepare to die!}
{130}{}{没人可以这样说我的妈妈！受死吧！}
#{131}{}{Yeah, not bad.  Well I got places to go and people to beat.  See ya', Dan.}
{131}{}{嗯，不错。看来我有地方去了，还能找人打一架。走啦，丹。}
#{132}{}{Yeah right, that's an okay line, but everyone uses it. Yer kiddin' right?
# Ya' wouldn't lay a hand on poor ol' Dan.}
{132}{}{好好好，说话总要有个分寸，但每个人都会探探底线。你在开玩笑是吧，你不会对可怜的老丹动手的吧。}
#{133}{}{Line? Hand? You wish. I'll lay much more than my hand on your soon
# to be dead carcass.}
{133}{}{分寸？动手？你想哦。我对你动的可不止是手！你马上就要成为一具死尸了。}
#{134}{}{Ha!  Had you going though, didn't I?}
{134}{}{哈！我跟你开玩笑的，这你都信啊？}
#{135}{}{Yeah, a little maybe. You're not too bad, kid. But just remember to
# keep that mouth of yours under control. I'd hate to see a good mouth go to waste.}
{135}{}{是啊，有那么一点。你不是那么坏嘛，小子。但是记住管好你的嘴巴，我可不想看到这么一张好嘴巴给人废了。}
#{136}{}{Sure, whatever you say. See ya', Dan.}
{136}{}{当然了，随你说。走啦，丹。}
#{137}{}{So, how do I join a caravan?}
{137}{}{那么，我怎么才能加入一支商队？}
#{138}{}{Bye. And stay away from my brahmin, you dirty little bastard.}
{138}{}{滚蛋。离我的双头牛远一点，你这个肮脏的小杂种。}
#{139}{}{Bye. And stay away from my brahmin, you dirty little bitch.}
{139}{}{滚蛋。离我的双头牛远一点，恶心小婊子。}
#{141}{}{Guards! Police! There's a Mad Man trying to kill me!}
{141}{}{保安！警察！这有个疯子要杀我！救命呀！}
#{142}{}{Well, I don't have any openings but ya' might wanna check with the Big Three.  There's a job post in
# the Merchant Market that might be of some help ta ya'. That's where they, and others, get their men.}
{142}{}{我没什么路子，不过你可以去“三巨头”那碰碰运气，商队市场那里有个招募广告牌大概对你有点用，他们既是靠这个招人的。}
#{143}{}{Oh, sorry . . . and women of course.}
{143}{}{喔，抱歉……当然，还有女人…}
#{144}{}{You don't have any openings?  Are you a merchant, too?}
{144}{}{你能没路子？你不也是商人吗？}
#{145}{}{Which way to the Merchant Market?}
{145}{}{去商队市场怎么走？}
#{146}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{146}{}{好的，多谢了。}
#{147}{}{Well no, not exactly.  I work very closely with most of the smaller merchant groups, though, and I know
# we're not hiring.}
{147}{}{哦不，我不是。我和很多小一些的商队关系比较近，所以我知道我们现在不招人。}
#{148}{}{Your loss.}
{148}{}{这是你的损失。}
#{149}{}{Okay, see ya' later, Dan.}
{149}{}{好的，一会见，丹。}
#{150}{}{So where's this Merchant Market?}
{150}{}{商队市场在哪儿？}
#{151}{}{Just go straight down this road.  It's smack dab in the center of the Hub -- ya' can't miss it.}
{151}{}{沿着路一直往下走。它就正好在哈勃城的中心－－你肯定能看到的。}
#{152}{}{That's none of yer business, stranger.}
{152}{}{那不关你事，陌生人。}
#{153}{}{I'm going to make it my business, 'stranger!'}
{153}{}{我要忙我的去了，“陌生人”！}
#{154}{}{Sorry to intrude.}
{154}{}{打搅了。}
#{155}{}{Why, hello again!  How are ya' doin'?}
{155}{}{啊，又见面了！你好吗？}
#{156}{}{I want to join a caravan.}
{156}{}{我想加入商队。}
#{157}{}{Uh, what services do you offer, exactly?}
{157}{}{呃，你这儿有啥来着？}
#{158}{}{Why the hell where you yelling at that poor kid?!}
{158}{}{你干嘛老冲着那个可怜的小毛孩大喊大叫？！}
#{159}{}{Fine. Bye.}
{159}{}{挺好的，再见。}
#{160}{}{Yuk.}
{160}{}{哈哈大笑。}
#{161}{}{What now？}
{161}{}{啥事？}
#{162}{}{Why the hell where you yelling at that poor kid？！}
{162}{}{你干嘛老冲着那个可怜的小毛孩大喊大叫？！}
#{163}{}{Nothing。}
{163}{}{没事。}
#{164}{}{Yuk。}
{164}{}{哈哈大笑。}
#{168}{}{Look, that kid was caught stealin'.  The police put'm in my care ta straighten'm out.}
{168}{}{瞧，那个偷东西的小贼给逮个正着。警察让我来教训教训他。}
#{169}{}{That's no reason to be so mean to him.}
{169}{}{没必要对他这么狠吧。}
#{170}{}{What's wrong with stealing?}
{170}{}{偷东西咋了？}
#{171}{}{Oh, that's different!  Give him hell!}
{171}{}{哦，那就另当别论了！好好教训他！}
#{172}{}{Are ya' daft? That's a quick way to rot away in a cell or get exiled without any food, clothing, or
# weapons.}
{172}{}{你傻啊，我有个好办法，就是把他关到牢里让他慢慢烂掉，或者干脆流放，不给吃，不给穿，更不给武器。}
#{173}{}{That still doesn't justify the way you're treating him!}
{173}{}{就是这样的话，你也不能这样对他。}
#{174}{}{Oh, okay.}
{174}{}{噢，好的。}
#{175}{}{I may not be the best role model in this damn city, but I'm the only
# one who cares and is willing ta try to help.  What have ya' done to improve society?}
{175}{}{我也许不是这遭瘟的城里最好的家伙，但我是这儿唯一一个会关心别人而且愿意提供帮助的人。你有为这个社会做过什么事没？}
#{176}{}{I've killed lots of things!}
{176}{}{我杀了好多好多东西！}
#{177}{}{I'm sorry, I've misjudged you.}
{177}{}{我很抱歉，我错怪你了。}
#{178}{}{You should have just killed the brat!}
{178}{}{你该杀了那个小混蛋！}
#{179}{}{Well, maybe you could be just a little nicer to him.  I think he's trying.}
{179}{}{嗯，那你也许能对他稍微和气一点。我想他在努力改正了。}
#{180}{}{You should give him a good whipping!}
{180}{}{你该赏他一顿鞭子！}
#{181}{}{Ya' think killing people solves the real problem?}
{180}{}{你认为杀人就能解决问题了？}
#{182}{}{Yep!}
{182}{}{没错！}
#{183}{}{It's been working for me so far!}
{183}{}{这对我来说一直很有效！}
#{184}{}{Hmmm, maybe not.}
{184}{}{唔，也许不是哦。}
#{185}{}{I don't know.}
{185}{}{我不知道。}
#{186}{}{You disappoint me. You seemed to have a good head on your shoulders.
# Killing them might get rid of the problem temporarily, but you've got to
# get at the root of the problem to really make a difference.}
{186}{}{你让我失望了。你肩膀上的脑袋看上去倒是挺聪明。杀人，也许可以解决一时的问题，但是却让这个问题从本质上变得完全不同了。}
#{187}{}{Yeah, whatever.}
{187}{}{是啊，随便啦。}
#{188}{}{Uh, okay. Bye.}
{188}{}{呃，好。拜拜。}
#{189}{}{You're an idiot.}
{189}{}{你这个白痴。}
#{190}{}{Well (he pauses looking off into space) . . . maybe yer right, partner.
 # I'll keep that in mind but I ain't promisin' ya' anything.}
{190}{}{嗯，【他停下来往四周看了看】……也许你是对的，伙计。我会考虑的，但是我不敢保证。}
#{191}{}{Are ya' kiddin'? That'd just make'm more defiant! My ways may not be
 # perfect but at least I know it'll make'm stronger and more responsible.}
{191}{}{你在开玩笑吧？那只会让我更加目空一切！我的方法或许不是最好的，但至少这可以让我变得更强，更有责任感。}
#{192}{}{Damn straight. Kill'n the person with the disease isn't the best way.
 # You've gotta find the cure because it's bound to surface again.}
{192}{}{该死，把得病的人杀了不是最好的办法。你肯定能找到治好他们的方法，因为它就要再次出现了。}
#{193}{}{No kidding, Einstein.}
{193}{}{别开玩笑了，你以为你是爱因斯坦啊。}
#{194}{}{Quit yer' yappin'! You're giving me a headache!}
{194}{}{少废话了，我头都疼了！}
#{195}{}{Uh, yeah, sure pal. I've gotta go.}
{195}{}{呃，是啊，没错，伙计。我得走了。}
#{196}{}{Well, try not ta solve all yer problems with a gun. Bye.}
{196}{}{嗯，别总用枪解决问题。再见。}
#{197}{}{Damn, it's hot today!}
{197}{}{妈的，真热！}
#{198}{}{Billy! Ya' better not be screw'n around, ya' little shit!}
{198}{}{比利！别在那游手好闲的，你这个垃圾！}
#{199}{}{Billy! Ya' better make sure those brahmin are kept warm tonight or
# it'll be yer hide!}
{199}{}{比利！你今晚最好让那些双头牛保持温暖，不然剥了你的皮！}
#{200}{}{Damn it, you little brat! Stop yappin' and start working!}
{200}{}{该死，你这个小混蛋！闭上你的狗嘴干活去！}
#{201}{}{I told you to stop screwing around!}
{201}{}{我跟你说了，不要游手好闲的！}
#{202}{}{I'm warning you, Billy!}
{202}{}{我警告你，比利！}
#{203}{}{You don't want the hard way, do you?}
{203}{}{你不是敬酒不吃吃罚酒吧？}
#{204}{}{Sorry kid, can't talk. I've got a business to run.}
{204}{}{抱歉，小子，我现在不能跟你掰，我得干活去了。}
#{208}{}{Sorry, can't talk. I've got a business to run.}
{208}{}{抱歉，我现在不能跟你扯淡，我得干活去了。}
#{209}{}{You'd better not be pester'n Billy; he's got a hell of a lot of work
# to do today.}
{209}{}{你最好别烦比利了，他今天有一大堆事要做。}
#{210}{}{Beat it, I'm busy.}
{201}{}{走开，我忙着呢。}
#{211}{}{Why are people always bother'n me?  Can't you see I'm work'n?}
{211}{}{为啥每个人都来烦我？你们没看到我正在忙吗？}
#{212}{}{Talk to the Merchants if you want a job. I'm not hiring.}
{212}{}{要工作的话跟那些商人说。我这里不招人。}
#{213}{}{Why don't ya' go play in the Maltese Falcon? I'm busy.}
{213}{}{你干嘛不去“马耳他猎鹰”那儿玩玩啊，我忙着呢。}
#{214}{}{What the hell are you doing here?  Get out!}
{214}{}{你到底要干嘛？滚！}
#{215}{}{I said get out! I'm not joke'n!  I'll blow yer frigg'n head off!}
{215}{}{我说了，滚！我不是在开玩笑！我他妈要剁了你！}
#{216}{}{Ya' punks will never learn, will ya'?}
{216}{}{你们这些小流氓永远都不懂，是吧！}
