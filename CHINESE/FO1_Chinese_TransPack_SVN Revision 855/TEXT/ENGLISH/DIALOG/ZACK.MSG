{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see Zack.}
#{101}{}{You see a Gun Runner.}
#{102}{}{Hi, I'm Zack. You want to buy weapons? Let me see what you have to trade.}
#{103}{}{No.}
#{104}{}{Ok.}
#{105}{}{Can you give me a discount?}
#{106}{}{You want to buy weapons? Let me see what you have to trade.}
#{107}{}{Sorry to bother you.}
#{108}{}{Nice doing business with you.}
#{109}{}{}
#{110}{}{Ok. Come back if you need anything.}
#{111}{}{You'd better make up your mind fast. Are you here to
# buy equipment, or did you just come here to get shot?}
#{112}{}{You have a real attitude problem.}
#{113}{}{Sorry, maybe I could use some equipment after all.}
#{114}{}{What the hell are you doing here then?}
#{115}{}{Nothing.}
#{116}{}{Sure.}
#{117}{}{Yeah, well until Gabriel says so, you've gotta pay
# full price like everybody else.}
#{118}{}{I don't know about that.}
#{119}{}{Show me what you have anyway.}
#{120}{}{Great! Show me what you got.}
#{121}{}{I'll stop by later for that discount.}
#{122}{}{Can I get a better discount?}
#{123}{}{Sorry.  I've given you the best discount I can.}
{100}{}{你看见赞克。}
{101}{}{你看见一个军火商。}
{102}{}{嗨，我是赞克。你想要买武器吗？让我看看你想要什么？}
{103}{}{不。}
{104}{}{好。}
{105}{}{你能给我一些折扣吗？}
{106}{}{你想要买武器吗？让我看看你想要什么？}
{107}{}{抱歉，打扰你了}
{108}{}{很高兴与你交易。}
{109}{}{}
{110}{}{好的，如果还需要什么欢迎再来。}
{111}{}{你最好快点做决定。你是想来买东西的还是想来吃子弹的？}
{112}{}{你真是态度有问题。}
{113}{}{不好意思，那我还是买点东西吧。}
{114}{}{那么你他妈的在这是干什么的？}
{115}{}{没什么。}
{116}{}{好的。}
{117}{}{是的，除非加布里尔允许，不然你必须象其他人一样支付原价。}
{118}{}{那个我不知道。}
{119}{}{让我看看你有的东西。}
{120}{}{太棒了，让我看看你的东西。}
{121}{}{那我在可以打折后再来光顾吧。}
{122}{}{能给我一些折扣吗？}
{123}{}{对不起，我已经尽可能给你便宜了。}
