#{122}{}{Huh?}
{122}{}{呃啊？}

#{123}{}{Oh. You must be looking for a job. Go and see Garl in the big room and leave us alone.}
{123}{}{哦。你一定是在找活儿干。去大房间里找伽尔吧，离我们远点。}

#{124}{}{Then do it elsewhere.}
{124}{}{那就到随便什么其他地方去。}

#{125}{}{Nah. I ain't seen her. Why are you asking?}
{125}{}{没。我没有见过她。为什么问起这个来？}

#{126}{}{Nothing. Just looking for a friend of mine.}
{126}{}{没什么。只是找我的一位朋友。}

#{127}{}{There is a bounty on her head. If I can kill her, I can get some good cash.}
{127}{}{有人在悬赏她的脑袋。如果我能杀了她的话，能搞好一笔钱呢。}

#{128}{}{You're lying. Where is she?}

#{130}{}{Really? What does she look like?}

#{131}{}{About 6 feet tall. Blonde. She's from Shady Sands.}
{131}{}{大约六英尺高。金发碧眼。她从沙荫镇来。}

#{132}{}{Yeah, she's here. She's in the big house. You know, if we tell Garl, then he would want a piece of the bounty. You might want to think about that.}
{132}{}{是的，她在这儿。她在大房子里。你看，如果我们告诉伽尔，那他就会分走一部分赏金。或许你应该考虑考虑这个。}

#{133}{}{You don't sound like you mean it. I think that you are up to something. And if you are telling the truth, then I'll bag the reward for myself.}
{133}{}{你的声音听起来不太确定。我想你牵扯着什么。如果你说的是实话，那么我就要独吞赏金了。}

#{134}{}{I . . . I can't say any more or Garl will kill me.}
{134}{}{我……我不能再说了，否则伽尔会杀了我的。}

#{135}{}{Bite me!}
{135}{}{滚一边去！}

#{136}{}{I don't like your looks. You'd better get away from me.}
{136}{}{我不喜欢你的样子。你最好从我面前滚开。}

#{137}{}{What? Go away!}
{137}{}{什么？滚开！}
