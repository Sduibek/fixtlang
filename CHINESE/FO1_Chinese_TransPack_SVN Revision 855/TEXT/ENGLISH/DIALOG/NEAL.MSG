#{118}{}{Who's the dangerous-looking stranger in the corner?}
{118}{}{那角落里凶神恶煞的人是谁？}

{119}{}{这帮孙子是谁？}

#{120}{}{【Neal looks at you quizzically for a moment.】 Haven't you ever seen a bar
# before, stranger? This is my place, the Skum Pitt. You buy drinks here. And you
# tip me.}
{120}{}{【尼尔上下打量了你一阵子。】你从没来过酒吧吗，我没见过你？这是我的地盘，斯卡・匹特。买饮料的话，要收小费。}

#{121}{}{Uh, right. I knew that. So, can I get a drink?}
{121}{}{啊，好的。我知道了。那么，给我来一杯？}

#{125}{}{What's that trophy on the shelf?}
{125}{}{在那架子上的是什么玩意儿？}

#{126}{}{Well, just over there to the west of us is Gizmo's casino. I'd be
# surprised if you didn't know about it; most of the people here are the ones who
# just finished losing their money there. Over in the other part of town you got
# Killian's general store, and Marcelles's Crash House. Killian's a good guy, runs
# a straight joint, carries everything you need. The Crash House is where you sleep
# it off when you've been in here for too long. 【Neal chuckles.】}
{126}{}{好吧，从我们这儿往西边是吉斯莫的赌场。我敢赌一把你知道的；好多赌客在那里输光了身上的钱。镇子里还有基利安的杂货店，玛塞尔的旅店。基利安是个好家伙，他的店里有你想要的任何东西。旅店是你“睡觉”的好地方，你会流连忘返。【尼尔吃吃的笑了。】}

#{127}{}{Thanks. Can I get a drink?}
{127}{}{谢了，给我来一杯。}

#{128}{}{Thanks for the information. See you around.}
{128}{}{谢谢你的消息。待会见。}

#{129}{}{Fella's called Tycho. Apparently a ranger from back east or something.
# Pretty nasty fighter, from what I hear, but a straight-up character.}
{129}{}{小伙子被称为提可。显然是从东方来的一个流浪者。我听说他是一个相当野蛮的斗士。}

#{130}{}{Mind if I ask some other questions?}
{130}{}{是否介意我问些别的问题？}

#{131}{}{Oh, them. They're the Skulz. They're a local gang. All the riff-raff.
#Sometimes they start fights or cause a little trouble. Usually Killian keeps them
# in line, though.}
{131}{}{哦，他们。他们是骷髅党。这一带的犯罪团伙。都是些流氓。他们时常为些小事而抄家伙，不过基利安一般都能让他们安分守己。}
#{132}{}{Here ya go. Enjoy.}
{132}{}{这是你的。享受吧。}

#{133}{}{Hey! You stole my urn!}
{133}{}{嘿！你偷了我的瓮！}

#{134}{}{That's not a trophy, it's an urn. It contains my wife's ashes -
# besides this bar, it is the most important thing in my life.}
{134}{}{那并不是装饰物，而是个骨灰盒。里面盛着我老婆的骨灰－是有这个酒吧之外我生命中最重要的东西了。}

#{135}{}{Anything else?}
{135}{}{还有别的事吗？}

#{136}{}{Looking for some more information.}
{136}{}{再多一点消息。}

#{142}{}{What happened to that trophy you used to have up there?}
{142}{}{放在那上面的玩意儿是啥？}

#{143}{}{Thank you. You can't know what this means to me. You'll never pay
# for a drink in this bar again.}
{143}{}{谢谢你。你绝不会知道这对我有多重要。以后你想在这里喝酒都算我的。}

#{144}{}{I've got your urn back for you.}
{144}{}{我把你的“老婆”找回来了。}

#{145}{}{Some slime stole it. It wasn't a trophy, it was an urn. It contained my wife's ashes - besides this bar, it was the most important thing in my life.}
{145}{}{哪些个杂碎偷走了它。那并不是个装饰品，那是个骨灰盒。我老婆住在里面－除了这个酒吧那是我生命中最重要的东西了。}

#{146}{}{Get the hell outta here you goddamn punks! If any of ya ever touch her
# again I'll kill the whole lot o' ya!}
{146}{}{你这该死的废物给我他妈的滚出去！你要再敢碰下她我就把你整个废了！}

#{147}{}{The day I can't handle little shits like you is the day I die!}
{147}{}{哪天我不能收拾像你这种狗屎的时候就是我死的那天！}

#{148}{}{What the hell ya doin'? We're closed. Get on out of here!}
{148}{}{你他妈的在做什么？酒吧关门了。滚蛋！}

#{149}{}{Ya damn kids, I'll show you a thing or two!}
{149}{}{小兔崽子，我得教你点做人的原则！}
