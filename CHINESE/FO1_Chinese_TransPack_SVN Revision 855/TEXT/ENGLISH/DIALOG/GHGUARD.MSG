{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

# {100}{}{You see a ghoul guard.}
# {101}{}{We're going to take you to Set. I think he'll want to talk to you, personally.}
# {102}{}{You shouldn't be here . . .}
# {103}{}{Garret told me it was OK. He told me to get something from Set's room for him. Do you know where it is?}
# {104}{}{OK. I'll just be leaving then.}
# {105}{}{Huh?}
# {106}{}{That doesn't sound right. You'd better come along with me.}
# {107}{}{I don't think so.}
# {108}{}{OK.}
# {109}{}{I don't think you want to go to that room.}
# {110}{}{Why not?}
# {111}{}{Ok, I don't want to go into that room. Now what?}
# {112}{}{I think you'd better be leaving.}
# {113}{}{We are here to make sure that people that don't belong in Set's room don't go into it. Not for Set's safety, actually, but for theirs. Anything else?}
# {114}{}{Yeah. Your shoelaces are untied.}
# {115}{}{Nah. Thanks.}
# {116}{}{I'm on duty. Go away.}
{100}{}{你看到一个僵尸守卫。}
{101}{}{你现在要跟我们走，赛特要见你。}
{102}{}{你不该在这里……}
{103}{}{盖瑞特告诉我它是好的，可以在赛特的房间找到一些。你知道它在哪里吗？}
{104}{}{好的，我只是来告别的。}
{105}{}{啊？}
{106}{}{那听起来不太正常，你继续说。}
{107}{}{我不这么认为。}
{108}{}{好的。}
{109}{}{我想你不会愿意去那个房间。}
{110}{}{为什么不？}
{111}{}{好吧，我不想去那个房间，现在做些什么呢？}
{112}{}{我认为你最好离开。}
{113}{}{我们在这里确保把那些不属于赛特的人拒之门外。当然，这不是为了赛特的安全，而是因为一些其他的事情。还有其他事吗？}
{114}{}{是的，你的鞋带松了。}
{115}{}{不了，谢谢。}
{116}{}{我在值班，离开这。}
