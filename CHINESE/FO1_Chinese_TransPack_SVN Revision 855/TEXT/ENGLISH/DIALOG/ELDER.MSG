{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see the Elder.}
#{101}{}{I am pleased to meet you. I hope you have found this little village pleasing so far.}
#{102}{}{Yes.}
#{103}{}{Nope, not enough action around here.}
#{104}{}{Excellent. I have a favor to ask of you. I promise that you will be well-rewarded for your services to this community.}
#{105}{}{Tell me more . . .}
#{106}{}{This is just a demo, but perhaps you will like what I have to say next.}
#{107}{}{I'm all ears . . .}
#{108}{}{We have been plagued by Rad Scorpions for some time now. All who have been sent to destroy these monsters have not returned. I will give you weapons and armor if you will follow my guide to their lair and kill them all.}
#{109}{}{Sounds good.}
#{110}{}{No thanks.}
#{111}{}{That is a shame. Please leave.}
#{112}{}{Excellent. Sammy here will guide you to the lair. Take these items - they will come in useful. }
#{113}{}{Please help us as soon as possible. Time is wasting.}
#{114}{}{I don't talk to your kind, stranger.}
{100}{}{你看到老人。}
{101}{}{很高兴见到你。希望这个小村子让你感觉宾至如归。}
{102}{}{是的。}
{103}{}{不，这没啥活动空间。}
{104}{}{好极了。我需要你帮个忙。而且我保证报酬会很丰厚的。}
{105}{}{告诉我更多。}
{106}{}{闲言少述，或许你会喜欢我接下来要说的。}
{107}{}{洗耳恭听……}
{108}{}{那些变异蝎子像瘟疫一样缠着我们。派去消灭那些怪物的人一个没回来。如果你愿意和我的向导去把它们全干掉我就送你武器和装备。}
{109}{}{听起来不错。}
{110}{}{不用了，谢谢。}
{111}{}{真遗憾。请你离开吧。}
{112}{}{太棒了。萨米会带你去蝎子窝。带上这些――你迟早会用到。}
{113}{}{请尽快帮助我们。别浪费时间。}
{114}{}{我们没什么好谈的，陌生人。}
