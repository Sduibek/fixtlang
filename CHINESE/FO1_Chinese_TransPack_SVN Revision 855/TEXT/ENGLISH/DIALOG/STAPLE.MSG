#{101}{}{You see a middle-aged woman.}
{101}{}{你看到一位中年妇女。}

#{102}{}{Hi, Welcome to the Library.  I don't think I have seen you around these parts
# before.   What might you be looking for in the way of knowledge?}
{102}{}{嗨，欢迎来到图书馆。我不认为我在这里见过你。你要寻找哪方面的知识呢？}

#{103}{}{Good to see you again.  What might you be looking for today?}
{103}{}{很高兴再次见到你，今天你要找什么呢？}

#{104}{}{What do you have in the way of books?}

#{105}{}{I am looking for a Water Chip.}

#{106}{}{Nothing, but thanks.}

#{107}{}{Well, let me show you my selection.}
{107}{}{来看看我的精选书籍吧。}

#{108}{}{Well, in my studies I have come across some references to such things.  Actually
# I have in my posession a Holodisk that contains a certain amount of information that you
# might find useful.}
{108}{}{我在研究中读到过一些提及这种东西的文章。我有一个磁盘，其中有大量你会觉得有用的信息。}

#{109}{}{A Holodisk, what is that?}
{109}{}{磁盘？那是什么？}

#{110}{}{Can I have the Holodisk?}
{110}{}{我能看看那个磁盘吗？}

#{111}{}{A Holodisk contains information on it, but it can only be read by a certain number
# of electronic devices.  I see that you have a PIP Boy. You can use that to decode, review,
# and store the information that a Holodisk contains.}
{111}{}{磁盘可以存储信息，但必须要有相应的电子设备才能阅读。我看到你有一个哔哔小子，你可以用它来阅读并且存储磁盘上的信息。}

#{112}{}{Sounds great! Can I have the Holodisk?}
{112}{}{听起来很不错！我能看看那个磁盘吗？}

#{113}{}{Information is hard to come by in this day and age.  I will need to charge you 750
# Hub Bucks for the disk.}
{113}{}{如今信息可是非常难得的哦。我需要你用750块哈勃币交换磁盘。}

#{114}{}{Sounds good. Here's the money.}
{114}{}{听起来还可以。给你钱。}

#{115}{}{Now that looks like a worn Holodisk if I've ever seen one.  I'll give you 500 for
# it.}
{115}{}{就是那个磁盘吗？我靠，我从来没见过这么破的磁盘。我只能给你500块。}

#{116}{}{How about I take a blowtorch to this whole place instead! Huh lady?!}
{116}{}{那我把整个地方用火焰喷射器给你装修一番如何啊？女士？！}

#{117}{}{Sorry, don't have the cash.}
{117}{}{对不起，我钱不够。}

#{118}{}{I am sorry but I can only accept the full amount for the Holodisk.  Please return
# when you have that amount.}
{118}{}{很抱歉，我没拿到足够的钱是不会把磁盘交给你的。等你有了钱再来找我吧。}

#{119}{}{I am sorry, but you wil need to keep your pyromaniacal tendencies to yourself.
# Please leave.}
{119}{}{很抱歉，不过我想你必须收起你那副纵火狂的嘴脸。请你离开。}

#{120}{}{【Mrs Stapleton takes your money.】}
{120}{}{【斯塔布雷顿夫人拿走了你的钱。】}

#{121}{}{You are right, the Disk has seen better days.  Since that is the case, I will
# accept 500 instead of my original price. 【Mrs Stapleton takes your money.】}
{121}{}{你说得对，这个磁盘的确应该有更好些的样子。因此我决定接受500块的价格。【斯塔布雷顿夫人拿走了你的钱。】}

#{122}{}{Normally, I do not give in to such methods, but to protect my collection from such
# a threat I will give you the Disk.  In exchange, I would ask that you never return here.}
{122}{}{通常我不会害怕这种威胁，但为了保护我的收藏，我会给你磁盘。作为交换，我要求你今后不许回到这里。}

#{123}{}{As I may have explained, you will need to use this and then access the information
# through your PIP Boy.  【Mrs. Stapleton hands you the Holodisk】}
{123}{}{我也许说过，你必须要通过你的哔哔小子来阅读这个。【斯塔布雷顿夫人将磁盘交给你】}

#{124}{}{You will have to excuse me, but I have research to do.}
{124}{}{请原谅，我还要做研究。}

#{125}{}{Ruk?}
{125}{}{啦呵？}

#{126}{}{I'm sorry, I don't understand you.  Somewhere I have a Holodisk on learning the English language, if you're intersted.}
{126}{}{对不起，我不明白你说的话。不过我有一个英语学习的磁盘。如果你是外国人，也许会对你有用的。}

#{127}{}{Goodbye.}
{127}{}{再见。}

#{128}{}{Thanks.}
{128}{}{谢谢。}

#{129}{}{Ug.}
{129}{}{呃。}

#{130}{}{Do you have a set of Chemistry journals?  Miles in Adytum said you might.}
{130}{}{你有整套的化学杂志吗？内城区的麦尔斯说你可能有。}

#{131}{}{Yes, I've heard from Miles and I have the ones he's looking for.  They will cost you 750 bucks.}
