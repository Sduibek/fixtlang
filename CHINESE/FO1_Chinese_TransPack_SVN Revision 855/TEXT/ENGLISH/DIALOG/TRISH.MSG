{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see Trish, a waitress from the Skum Pitt.}
#{101}{}{What the hell are you doing in my room?}
#{102}{}{Gug!}
#{103}{}{Whoops, sorry. I thought this was my room.}
#{104}{}{Sorry. Bye.}
#{105}{}{No way! I'm not into that! Go talk to Sinthia down the hall. She might
# be available, but she is never free.}
#{106}{}{Yeah, right. Whatever. This is my room. Get the hell out.}
#{107}{}{What the hell are you doing in my room?}
#{108}{}{Grub!}
#{109}{}{Whoops, sorry. I thought this was my room.}
#{110}{}{Do you know a guy named Saul?}
#{111}{}{I used to think so. Now, I'm not so sure.}
#{112}{}{He really cares about you.}
#{113}{}{I think you should dump him.}
#{114}{}{So he says. If he did, he wouldn't be doing what he is doing.}
#{115}{}{What's that?}
#{116}{}{His boxing, right?}
#{117}{}{You would say that. you want to take his place right?}
#{118}{}{Nah. You're too shanky.}
#{119}{}{Sure.}
#{120}{}{Just leave me alone.}
#{121}{}{Maybe you're right. Maybe I need to understand what he does and leave it
# at that.}
#{122}{}{His fighting, of course. I don't get it.}
#{123}{}{It's a man thing.}
#{124}{}{Of course not, dearie.}
#{125}{}{Of course it's his boxing. He's a really nice guy, but he needs
# to get out of it before it kills him.}
#{126}{}{Maybe that's what he wants to do.}
#{127}{}{Hey, I met you at the Skum Pitt. What the hell are you doing in my room?}
#{128}{}{Plato}
#{129}{}{I wanted to get a closer look at you.}
#{130}{}{I wanted to get some info from you, and I didn't want to do it in front
# of that bartender.}
#{131}{}{Just leave me the hell alone, you loser. Sinthia might be your kind
# of woman, but I sure as hell ain't.}
#{132}{}{You should leave me alone. I really don't want to talk to you.}
#{133}{}{Sorry to disturb you.}
#{134}{}{Get out of my room!}
#{135}{}{I'm gonna get Marcelles, and she'll clean your clock.}
#{136}{}{My boyfriend could beat you up.}
#{137}{}{Look, this is my room. Please leave.}
#{138}{}{Thanks for helping out with Saul. He's really a neat guy.}
#{139}{}{You got my boyfriend killed. I should hate you, but I knew it was going
# to happen sooner or later. Please leave me alone.}
#{140}{}{Hey, thanks for helping me out when those Skulz jumped me. There aren't many
# people willing to do that sort of thing these days.}
#{141}{}{Hnnn.}
#{142}{}{You're welcome. See you around.}
#{143}{}{You're welcome. Could I ask you a few questions?}
#{144}{}{I guess so.}
#{145}{}{Who owns the bar?}
#{146}{}{Who is Gizmo?}
#{147}{}{Why did you scream about Saul?}
#{148}{}{Thanks, bye.}
#{149}{}{Neal owns the bar. He's a good guy, always treated me right. We
# used to date, but he got a little too serious for my liking. I don't want
# to be a widow.}
#{150}{}{Oh! Saul, where are you?!?}
#{151}{}{Zzzz}
#{152}{}{Sorry, we're closed. Come back later.}
#{153}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
#{154}{}{Gizmo runs the Casino. He would like to take over Neal's bar, but Neal
# doesn't want to sell.}
#{155}{}{ Killian and Gizmo do not like each other. One of them will either have
# to leave town or be buried beneath it.}
#{156}{}{Welcome to the Skum Pitt. Can I get you something to drink?}
#{157}{}{Yes, what do you have?}
#{158}{}{Saul is my boyfriend. He's really good to me.}
#{159}{}{Actually, can I ask you some questions?}
#{160}{}{No, as a matter of fact, you can't. If you aren't going to order a drink,
# then you're in the wrong place.}
#{161}{}{What would you like?}
#{162}{}{Gizmo, well, Gizmo means to take over the bar. And if Neal won't sell,
# I bet some bad things will happen.}
#{163}{}{One day, some punk is going to kill Neal for a glass of friggin' water
# or something stupid like that. In case you haven't noticed, running a bar
# is tough work these days.}
#{164}{}{Nuka-cola, 3 caps.}
#{165}{}{Beer, 5 caps.}
#{166}{}{The hard stuff, 20 caps.}
#{167}{}{You see a waitress.}
#{168}{}{Still, working for Gizmo is going to kill him.}
#{169}{}{No, but you can't change him, and he can't change you. If you don't like
# what he does, then you should look elsewhere.}
#{170}{}{Hnnngh! Hoo!}
#{171}{}{Sorry, it looks like you're already a little gone.}
#{172}{}{You gain 300 experience points for helping to defeat the Skulz in the
# bar fight.}
#{173}{}{You gain 250 experience points for saving Saul and Trish's relationship.}
#{174}{}{Here you go. Enjoy.}

{100}{}{你看到特里诗，女招待。}
{101}{}{你在我的房间做什么！？}
{102}{}{啊！}
{103}{}{哦，抱歉。还以为这是我的房间呢。}
{104}{}{抱歉。再见。}
{105}{}{别来这套！去找大厅辛西娅去。没准她会上你的钩，不过她可没什么空。}
{106}{}{好吧，随便你怎么说。这是我的房间。出去！}
{107}{}{你在我的房间做什么！？}
{108}{}{啊……}
{109}{}{哦，抱歉。还以为这是我的房间呢。}
{110}{}{你认识一个叫索尔的家伙吗？}
{111}{}{以前……也许吧，现在就不知道了。}
{112}{}{他真的很在乎你。}
{113}{}{我觉得你该甩了他。}
{114}{}{是吗？如果是真的他不会象现在这样的。}
{115}{}{哪样？}
{116}{}{你是说他打拳，对吗？}
{117}{}{你当然这么说。你想代替他的位置对吗？}
{118}{}{没有。你想太多了。}
{119}{}{当然。}
{120}{}{走开。}
{121}{}{也许你是对的。我应该理解他在做的事，不去管这些。}
{122}{}{当然，他的拳赛。我不理解。}
{123}{}{这是很爽的事情。}
{124}{}{当然不，亲爱的。}
{125}{}{当然是因为他的拳赛。他是个好男人。但他必须停止打拳，不然会被打死的。}
{126}{}{也许这是他想做的事情啊。}
{127}{}{嘿，我在萨姆・匹特见过你。你在我房间到底要干什么？}
{128}{}{柏拉图}
{129}{}{我想仔细看看你。}
{130}{}{我想从你这得到些信息，我不想在那酒保面前那么做。}
{131}{}{走开了，衰人。辛西娅也许会吃你这套，我绝对不会！}
{132}{}{你不该来打扰我。我完全不想跟你说话。}
{133}{}{很抱歉打扰你了。}
{134}{}{离开我的房间！}
{135}{}{我要叫玛塞尔了，她会摆平你的。}
{136}{}{我男朋友会揍扁你的。}
{137}{}{听着，这是我的房间。请离开。}
{138}{}{谢谢你帮助索尔。他的确是个好人。}
{139}{}{你让我的男朋友死了。我该恨你的，不过我也知道那是早晚的事情。别来烦我了。}
{140}{}{谢谢你在骷髅党那些人找麻烦的时候帮了我。现在会有这种行为的人可不多了。}
{141}{}{恩。}
{142}{}{没什么，再见了。}
{143}{}{没什么。能问点事情吗。}
{144}{}{我想是的。}
{145}{}{这个酒吧是谁开的？}
{146}{}{吉斯莫是谁？}
{147}{}{你为什么对索尔吼？}
{148}{}{谢谢，再见。}
{149}{}{尼尔是老板。他是个好人，对我不错。以前我们交往过，但他有点太较真了，我可不想做寡妇。}
{150}{}{哦！索尔。你在哪里？！}
{151}{}{Zzzz}
{152}{}{抱歉，我们打烊了。晚点再过来吧。}
{153}{}{没事，谢谢。}
{154}{}{吉斯莫是赌场的老板。他想接手尼尔的酒吧，但是尼尔不想卖。}
{155}{}{基利安跟吉斯莫不和。他们两人中一个得离开镇子，不然就会被埋在这镇子下面。}
{156}{}{欢迎来到萨姆・匹特。想要喝什么？}
{157}{}{是的，你们有什么？}
{158}{}{索尔是我男朋友。他待我很好。}
{159}{}{其实，我是想问你几个问题，可以吗？}
{160}{}{不，不行。如果你不是来喝东西的，那你就来错地方了。}
{161}{}{想要什么？}
{162}{}{吉斯莫，啊，吉斯莫肯定要接手这酒吧的。如果尼尔坚持不卖，会有不好的事情发生。}
{163}{}{总有一天，某个混蛋会因为杯水或者别的什么蠢理由杀掉尼尔的。如果你没发觉的话，我来告诉你，这年月开酒吧可不是那么好赚的。}
{164}{}{核子可乐，3个瓶盖。}
{165}{}{啤酒，5个瓶盖。}
{166}{}{烈的，20个瓶盖。}
{167}{}{你看到一个女招待。}
{168}{}{不管怎样，他为吉斯莫做事会死的。}
{169}{}{不，不过他改变不了你，你也改变不了他，如果你不喜欢他的所作所为，就该另想办法。}
{170}{}{哈哈！吼！}
{171}{}{抱歉，看来你已经有点醉了。}
{172}{}{因为在酒吧帮忙击退了骷髅党，你得到300点经验。}
{173}{}{因为挽救了索尔和特里诗的关系，你得到250点经验。}
{174}{}{给。尽情享用吧。}
