# {101}{}{There are cables running from the access computer to the warhead behind it.}
# {102}{}{You have armed the warhead. A timer with four minutes has started a countdown.}
# {103}{}{You have disarmed the nuclear warhead.}
# {104}{}{BOOOOOOOOOM! 【You have set off the nuke!】}
# {105}{}{That doesn't seem to be working.}
# {106}{}{The countdown is still going . . . maybe you should cut that red wire.}
# {107}{}{Maybe you need to use the key also.}

{100}{}{这台计算机标签上写着原子控制计算机。}
{101}{}{有电缆从计算机连接到核弹的后面。}
{102}{}{你检查这个核弹，发现上面有一个4分钟的计时器已经开始倒计时了。}
{103}{}{你拆除这个核弹。}
{104}{}{轰……隆【你引爆了核弹！】}
{105}{}{那是不能操作的。}
{106}{}{倒计时仍然在继续……也许你应该剪断红色电线。}
{107}{}{也许你应该使用别的钥匙。}
