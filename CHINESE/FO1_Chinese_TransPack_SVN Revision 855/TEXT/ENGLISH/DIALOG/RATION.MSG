#{112}{}{Hello, }
#{113}{}{.
# Have you found the water chip yet?}
#{114}{}{No, not yet.}
#{115}{}{I will. How are you doing?}
#{116}{}{Urug!}
#{117}{}{Oh . . . you don't understand me. I guess we really don't have
# much hope after all. Excuse me while I cry.}
#{118}{}{Ugg!}
#{119}{}{Please find it before my baby dies of thirst.}
#{120}{}{【Done】}
#{121}{}{You've got to find it! Don't let us die like this!}
#{122}{}{【Done】}
#{123}{}{Keep trying. I believe in you. I know you will do everything
# you can to save us.}
#{124}{}{【Done】}
#{125}{}{I am afraid of what is happening. Someone has been stealing
# water and now everyone is on edge.}
#{126}{}{Who would do such a thing?}
#{127}{}{What happened?}
#{128}{}{Some people have been accused and fights have broken out
# over it but nobody really knows.}
#{129}{}{Ok. Thanks.}
#{130}{}{Some people reported that their water had been stolen.
# They weren't given more water but some friends shared
# with them. After this everybody got very paranoid and
# started guarding their water. A few days later
# someone knocked the guard out in the ration supply area
# and stole water.}
#{131}{}{That is terrible! What can I do?}
#{132}{}{Maybe you can stop whoever is doing this.}
#{133}{}{I'll take a look around.}

{110}{}{你看到丝黛西。}
{111}{}{你看到苏珊。}
{112}{}{你好，}
{113}{}{。你找到净水芯片了吗？}
{114}{}{没，还没找到。}
{115}{}{我的天哪。你在做什么？}
{116}{}{哦！}
{117}{}{噢……你不明白。很抱歉我失态了，但是我现在真的很绝望。}
{118}{}{呃！}
{119}{}{求求你在我孩子渴死前找到它。}
{120}{}{【确定】}
{121}{}{你会找到它的！别让我们就这样渴死！}
{122}{}{【确定】}
{123}{}{加油。我相信你，不论发生什么你都会赶回来救我们的。}
{124}{}{【确定】}
{125}{}{现在的情况很不好。已经有人开始偷水了，避难所的秩序也在崩溃的边缘。}
{126}{}{谁会去做这样的事情？}
{127}{}{发生了什么？}
{128}{}{人们相互指责并爆发了群殴，但是没人了解真相。}
{129}{}{好的。非常感谢。}
{130}{}{已经有许多人因储存水被盗而报警。幸亏一些朋友分给他们水他们才没有陷入窘困境。这也使得很多人变得过分敏感，开始日夜守着他们的水。几天后更发生了袭击配给供应区警卫人员的偷水事件。}
{131}{}{那太可怕了！我又能怎么办呢？}
{132}{}{也许你能找出是谁干了这件事。}
{133}{}{我去看看能做啥。}
