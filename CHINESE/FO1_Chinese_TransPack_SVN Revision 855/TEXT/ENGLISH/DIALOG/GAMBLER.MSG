#{136}{}{Buenos dias, my friend! What can I do for you today?}
#{137}{}{Buenos dias, my friend! What can I do for you today?}

#{100}{}{You see a seedy-looking Mexican man with slick hair.}
#{101}{}{You see Hernandez, the rascally gambler.}
#{102}{}{Oye, muchacho, allow me to introduce myself. I am Hernandez,
# a man of mucho gusto! You look like you are new here. Please,
# allow me to be your informant to the casino.}
#{103}{}{Can you tell me about the casino?}
#{104}{}{No, thanks.}
#{105}{}{Bloo?}
#{106}{}{But of course! This fine establishment is run by
# the famous Gizmo. A true visionary and a very wealthy
# man.}
#{107}{}{Thanks.}
#{108}{}{You say Gizmo is a visionary. What's his vision?}
#{109}{}{What are the odds like on the games here?}
#{110}{}{My friend, I hate to impose, but perhaps you could assist me.
# I have developed a sure-fire system, because I have discovered
# how Gizmo runs his tables, but I do not have the caps to
# play.}
{100}{}{你看到一个头发油腻腻，衣着破烂的墨西哥人。}
{101}{}{你看到赫尔南德斯，一个流氓赌棍。}
{102}{}{哦，哈，请允许我介绍，我是赫尔南德斯，热心肠的好人。你是刚到这里来的吧。请允许我做你的向导。}
{103}{}{跟我说说这赌场。}
{104}{}{不用了，谢谢。}
{105}{}{啵？}
{106}{}{当然了。这场子是归在大名鼎鼎的吉斯莫名下。一个真正有远见又富有的人。}
{107}{}{谢谢。}
{108}{}{你说吉斯莫有远见，什么远见啊？}
{109}{}{这里赢钱的机会大吗？}
{110}{}{我的朋友，我是讨厌出千的，但是没准你能帮我。我弄出了一套必胜大法，因为我已经弄清他们的门道了。只是我没有瓶盖。}
#{111}{}{ 【You get the feeling that he's trying to scam you.】}
#{112}{}{Perhaps you can spare a few caps? I guarantee success.}
#{113}{}{Sure, sounds good.}
#{114}{}{No, thanks.}
#{115}{}{I think you're lying. You're trying to scam me.}
#{116}{}{Sorry, mi amigo. Hey, let me show you a neat game . . .}
#{117}{}{Thank you very much, mi amigo! In a few days I shall be able
# to pay you back, with interest. My system is slow, you see,
# it requires much patience, but it will most certainly reap
# great profits!}
#{118}{}{Very well, but I guarantee success! If you want to get in
# on the riches just waiting, come back soon, or I will find
# another partner!}
#{119}{}{My friend, I see you are a man of much taste, as well.
# Perhaps a simple game of dice?}
#{120}{}{All right!}
#{121}{}{No, thanks, I'd rather try something else.}
#{122}{}{Gizmo had a dream of setting up a place where people
# could meet and enjoy themselves. He had the ambition to
# make it happen. The result is the casino you see here.}
{111}{}{ 【你觉得他是在骗你。】}
{112}{}{你有闲钱吗？我保证赚的。}
{113}{}{当然，听起来不错。}
{114}{}{还是算了。}
{115}{}{你撒谎，你是想坑我吧？}
{116}{}{对不起，朋友。嘿，我让你看看什么叫高手……}
{117}{}{谢谢谢谢，哦朋友啊朋友啊。几天内我就连本带利还给你。你要知道我这方法是循序渐进的嘛，要有耐心。但是一定能赚一大笔的。}
{118}{}{很好，但是我一定赢的。如果你想傻站就能捞钱，就快点回来，不然我就另找搭档了。}
{119}{}{朋友，我看出来你也是个很有品位的人，玩玩色子怎么样？}
{120}{}{好啊。}
{121}{}{算了，我还不如弄点的别的呢。}
{122}{}{吉斯莫一直想弄一个大家可以在一起玩乐的地方。他也的确做到了。你看到了，就是这个赌场。}
#{123}{}{He gives people a chance to shrug off their cares in the
# broken world outside. And he brings money into Junktown!}
#{124}{}{Sounds like a good idea.}
#{125}{}{Life's hard enough. I don't trust the motives of someone
# who would encourage people to lose their money.}
#{126}{}{You obviously don't share Gizmo's brilliance. This place
# is a respite from the harshness of everyday life.}
#{127}{}{Well, Gizmo runs a pretty good house, although the games are,
# how shall we say, rather weighted towards the house.
# It's not like his dealers cheat, though. But unless you have
# a system, like me, you will need to be very clever.}
#{128}{}{Thanks.}
#{129}{}{}
#{130}{}{How is your system coming?}
#{131}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
#{132}{}{My system is developing slowly. I have living expenses
# and such, you know, but it is working!}
#{133}{}{That's great!}
#{134}{}{I think that you are a liar and a cheat. Where's my money?}
#{135}{}{So, you think you have tumbled to me, eh? Well, you won't
# get anything from me!}

{123}{}{他让人们可以忘记外面那个烂世界。当然也让迦克镇财源滚滚。}
{124}{}{好主意。}
{125}{}{世道够惨的了。我可不想信任一个“鼓励”大家输钱的家伙。}
{126}{}{你显然不理解吉斯莫的才智。这个地方可以缓解生活的痛苦。}
{127}{}{吉斯莫这场子的确不错，虽然这的游戏有点……怎么说呢，就是用来搞钱盖这个房子的。可他的荷官好象没有作弊。除非你象我这样有办法，不然你就得是超级聪明人。}
{128}{}{谢谢。}
{129}{}{}
{130}{}{你那必胜法哪来的？}
{131}{}{不了，谢谢。}
{132}{}{我这方法进展的很慢。你知道，我也要过日子嘛，不过这方法的确有用！}
{133}{}{太好了！}
{134}{}{我认为你是个骗子，老千！钱还我！}
{135}{}{你觉得你能搞到我吗，啊？你别想从我这得到任何东西。}

{136}{}{你好啊，伙计！今天我能为你做点什么？}
