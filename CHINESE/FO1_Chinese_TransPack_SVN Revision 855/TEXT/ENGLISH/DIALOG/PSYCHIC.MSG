{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see Gideon, a normal looking human. He is wearing a crown.}
#{101}{}{Jason is a living god! Only the nullified may pass!}
#{102}{}{Nullified? Are they somehow restricting your psychic powers by those
# devices you are wearing?}
#{103}{}{Who's Jason?}
#{104}{}{What do you mean by nullified?}
#{105}{}{I just killed him, so he must be a dead god, now. Would you like to
# join him?}
#{106}{}{Huh?}
#{107}{}{The walls also have minds... I saw you... tomorrow?}
#{108}{}{Others like you are in the wall?}
#{109}{}{Never mind.}
#{110}{}{I'd like to kill you now. Could you open this force field?}
#{111}{}{Open the forcefield and I'll let you out.}
#{112}{}{Uh, yeah. Are you the 'experiments' I'm looking for?}
#{113}{}{Jason? Who's Jason?}
#{114}{}{You just said... Nevermind.}
#{115}{}{Stup.}
#{116}{}{Yes, the walls are alive with those that have gone before.}
#{117}{}{What happened to them?}
#{118}{}{Uh, I've got to go.}
#{119}{}{Meeting of the soul... melded with, to protect, the Master of all.}
#{120}{}{I see. How do I protect myself from the protectors of the Master?}
#{121}{}{What about the dogs of war?}
#{122}{}{I need to protect the Master. How do I get to him?}
#{123}{}{I can kill anyone or anything. Open this forcefield and I'll
# demonstrate.}
#{124}{}{Goodbye.}
#{125}{}{There is only peace and joining.. the price.. the pain.. one must be
# blind.. nulled.}
#{126}{}{Well, I need to join. Where can I pick up one of those snazzy nullifiers?}
#{127}{}{Great! How do I join?}
#{128}{}{I'd like to join my gun with your head!}
#{129}{}{I don't have time for this. Goodbye.}
#{130}{}{I will anoint you... I must give what I must not.}
#{131}{}{Thanks.}
#{132}{}{No one's anointing me, you insane bastard!}
#{133}{}{Anoint? Anoint me with what?}
#{134}{}{No, thanks.}
#{135}{}{You cannot kill the genius of... the all.. You... hehf!}
#{136}{}{Yeah, but I can cause it one hell of a lot of pain.}
#{137}{}{I don't want to kill. I want to worship.}
#{138}{}{Obviously. Goodbye.}
#{139}{}{Phlegm! Insubstantial development... communication, null... end of death.}
#{140}{}{The walls also have minds... I saw you... tomorrow was it?}
#{141}{}{I'll take that as a yes.}
#{142}{}{Great! How do I join?}
#{143}{}{The blasphemous.. decompose.. death will be.. salvation.. strong!}
#{144}{}{The minds... the walls... before the great one.}
#{145}{}{Those who have gone before... must stop your journey.}
#{146}{}{I need to change that.}
#{147}{}{I must complete my journey, the master wills it.}
#{148}{}{Who? Did what?}
#{149}{}{Yeah, but I can cause them a whole lot of pain.}
#{150}{}{Sorry to disturb you again. Goodbye.}
#{151}{}{I'd like to help you escape.}
#{200}{}{You see Moore, a scruffy looking fellow. He is wearing a crown.}
#{201}{}{You see a scruffy looking fellow.}
#{202}{}{The asphalt shall run red!! I will crush!}
#{203}{}{Exactly.}
#{204}{}{What are you talking about?}
#{205}{}{Yeah, it'll be red with your blood.}
#{206}{}{Uh, yeah. Goodbye.}
#{207}{}{Urgh!}
#{208}{}{I will stop the motor! The master gave me the power...}
#{209}{}{Okay, Hank. I'd like to meet the Master, how do I get there?}
#{210}{}{What motor?}
#{211}{}{Of course! I understand completely...}
#{212}{}{I'd like to split your head open, you blithering idiot.}
#{213}{}{Oh, not you again. Goodbye.}
#{214}{}{Only the powerful can pass, but they will be kept from passing.}
#{215}{}{Open this force field, I want to show you my power.}
#{216}{}{But I have to see the Master!}
#{217}{}{Can you show me how?}
#{218}{}{Gideon... Gideon speaks the way.}
#{219}{}{Exactly.}
#{300}{}{You see Lucy, a normal looking human female. She is wearing a crown.}
#{301}{}{You see a human female. She is staring at your shoes.}
#{302}{}{There is no place like home, no place like home, no place like home...
# 【pacing back and forth】}
#{303}{}{Hng!}
#{304}{}{Stop that!}
#{305}{}{What about this place? Isn't this your home?}
#{306}{}{I agree. Completely and utterly. You're right... 【she pauses for a
# moment】 What did you say? Oh, never you mind.}
#{307}{}{【looking at you intensely】 I will slay you for that! I will make your
# blood run red. Wait a minute. Blood is red, how can I make it run red? I
# can't very well do that. Hmmm. I need to think about this. Go away!}
#{308}{}{My home is, uh, yeah. Here. Yeah, it's here. This is my home! 【she
# jumps up and down】 I am so happy! You can't believe how happy this makes me.
# I think I'm going to go punch the wall for a while.}
#{309}{}{I'm busy. I almost have the solution to the environmental problems
# fucking this world over, but I can't stop thinking about purple dinosaurs.
# Is this a problem?}
#{310}{}{Stop bugging me, I'm thinking...}
#{400}{}{You see Wiggum, a complete loser. He is wearing a crown.}
#{401}{}{You see what looks to be a complete loser.}
#{402}{}{I'm tired.}
#{403}{}{My life is hell.}
#{404}{}{I'm tired of living.}
#{405}{}{Darkness comes.}
#{406}{}{Whatever.}
#{500}{}{A sign on the wall reads: 'Warning! Do not Disturb!'}

{100}{}{你看到基登，相貌普通的人类。他戴着头箍。}
{101}{}{贾森是活的神！圆满的才可通过。}
{102}{}{圆满？他们用你戴着的那装置扰乱了你的精神吗？}
{103}{}{贾森是谁？}
{104}{}{圆满是什么意思？}
{105}{}{我刚杀了他，现在想来，他是个死的神了。想跟他一样吗？}
{106}{}{哈？}
{107}{}{墙壁也有思想……我……明天见过你？}
{108}{}{其他跟你一样的人在墙里？}
{109}{}{算了。}
{110}{}{真想现在就杀了你。不过你能打开这力场吗？}
{111}{}{打开力场，不然你死定了。}
{112}{}{啊，对拉。你就是我要找的“实验”吧？}
{113}{}{贾森？贾森是谁？}
{114}{}{你刚才说……算了。}
{115}{}{停！}
{116}{}{对，墙是活的和那些从前就走掉的。}
{117}{}{他们怎么了？}
{118}{}{啊，我得走了。}
{119}{}{灵魂的会面……合并，去保护，主教一切。}
{120}{}{明白了。我怎么保护自己不受主教的“保护”？}
{121}{}{狗的战争呢？}
{122}{}{我得保护主教。怎么能找到他。}
{123}{}{挡我者死！我会证明给你看的，如果你不打开这力场的话。}
{124}{}{再见。}
{125}{}{这是唯一的和平，统一……代价……痛苦……必须让个人盲目……麻痹}
{126}{}{好吧，我要加入。上哪能拿到那个傻兮兮的头箍？}
{127}{}{太好了！怎么加入？}
{128}{}{我想崩了你的头！}
{129}{}{我没空玩这个，再见。}
{130}{}{我会净化你，必须给予我所不能。}
{131}{}{谢谢。}
{132}{}{去你的净化，你这个白痴杂种！}
{133}{}{净化？用什么净化？}
{134}{}{不了，谢谢。}
{135}{}{你不能杀掉万中无一的天才，你这个……嚯啊！}
{136}{}{对啊，可我会带来巨大的痛苦！}
{137}{}{我不想杀戮。我要敬拜。}
{138}{}{很明显，再见！}
{139}{}{镇定！脆弱的发展……交流，无效……死亡尽头。}
{140}{}{墙也有思想……我明天……见过你，是吗？}
{141}{}{我当你同意了。}
{142}{}{太好了！怎么加入？}
{143}{}{亵渎……瓦解……死亡将……拯救……力量！}
{144}{}{思想……墙……在伟大之前……}
{145}{}{之前走的人……会阻止你的。}
{146}{}{我得把那改变。}
{147}{}{我必须完成这行程，是主教的意思。}
{148}{}{谁？怎么？}
{149}{}{对，不过他们也不会好过。}
{150}{}{很抱歉打扰了你。再见。}
{151}{}{我想帮你逃走。}
{200}{}{你看到穆尔，穿着破烂的家伙。他戴着头箍。}
{201}{}{你看见一个穿着破烂的家伙。}
{202}{}{道路要被染红！我将破坏！}
{203}{}{对啊！}
{204}{}{你说什么呢？}
{205}{}{是啊，被你的血染红！}
{206}{}{啊对，再见。}
{207}{}{啊！}
{208}{}{我将阻止恒动！主教给了我力量……}
{209}{}{好吧，汉克。我想见主教，怎么走？}
{210}{}{什么恒动？}
{211}{}{当然了。我很了解……}
{212}{}{我想把你的头劈开！你这个扯淡的白痴。}
{213}{}{哦，怎么又来了。再见。}
{214}{}{只有充满力量的可以通过，但他们会阻止的……}
{215}{}{打开这个力场，不然就让你看看我的力量。}
{216}{}{但我需要见主教。}
{217}{}{能教我怎么做吗？}
{218}{}{基登……基登告诉路。}
{219}{}{对哦。}
{300}{}{你看到露西，看起来正常的人类女性。她戴着头箍。}
{301}{}{你见到一个女性人类，她在盯着你的鞋。}
{302}{}{这里不是家园，这里不是家园，这里不是家园……【前后晃着】}
{303}{}{哈！}
{304}{}{够了！}
{305}{}{这地方怎么了？不是你的家？}
{306}{}{我同意。完全彻底同意。你是对的……【她顿了一下】你刚才说什么？哦，你不会注意的。}
{307}{}{【紧张的看着你】我会为此杀掉你！我会让你的血红掉。等等，血本来就是红的，我怎么能让它再红？这我做不来。恩，我得想想，走开！}
{308}{}{我的家，啊，对。这里。是的，是这里。这是我家。【她上蹿下跳的】我太高兴了。你不知道这让我多高兴。我想我得去捶会儿墙。}
{309}{}{忙着呢。我几乎搞定让这世界如此操蛋的环境问题了，但我一直想着紫色的恐龙，停不下来，这有问题吗？}
{310}{}{别烦我了，我在思考……}
{400}{}{你看到维刚，彻底的失败者。他戴着头箍。}
{401}{}{你看到一个彻底的失败者的样子。}
{402}{}{我累了。}
{403}{}{生活是地狱。}
{404}{}{我活够了。}
{405}{}{黑暗降临，}
{406}{}{随便吧。}
{500}{}{墙上写着“警告！请勿打扰！”}
