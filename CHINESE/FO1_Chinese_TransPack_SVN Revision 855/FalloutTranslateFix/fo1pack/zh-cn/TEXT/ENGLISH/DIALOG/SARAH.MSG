{105}{}{你不是非得杀了他！【莎拉发出呜咽声。】滚开。}
#{106}{}{He was my lover. He was my best friend. I can't believe that you
# did that to him.}
 {106}{}{他是我的爱人。他是我最好的朋友。我不能相信你对他这样做了。}
#{107}{}{Again, I apologize. How could I tell that he meant so much to you?

#{108}{}{I'm going to kill all of his kind.}

#{118}{}{You should be in your cell. The guards are keeping us here for our
# protection. The robots have been programmed to attack unescorted normals.
# Once I've been dipped, I'll be able to spend time helping the Unity.}
{118}{}{你应该在你的小隔间里。卫兵为了保护我们留我们在这儿。机器人已经被设好程序去攻击没有护卫的平民。一旦我被浸渍了，我就会有能力花时间帮助“同一”事业。}
#{119}{}{Yeah, okay. Whatever. Have fun.}
{119}{}{是，好的。管它呢。玩得开心。}

#{123}{}{Can you excuse us, we're talking here!}
{123}{}{对不起，我们在这儿说话！}
