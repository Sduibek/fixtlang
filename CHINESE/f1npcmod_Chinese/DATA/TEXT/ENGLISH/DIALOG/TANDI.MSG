{113}{}{还好吧。我还可以问你一些问题吗？}
#{114}{}{Hell, yes. There's nothing to do here but watch the Brahma mate.}
{114}{}{嗯，可不。这儿除了看双头牛交配以外就没什么好做的了。}
#{115}{}{I guess it's okay.}
{115}{}{我觉得还凑合。}
#{116}{}{Well, yes. It is a bit boring.}
{116}{}{嗯，是的。是有一点无聊。}
#{117}{TAND_3}{ Sure, I guess.  I've never been out of here, so I don't know

{117}{TAND_3}{当然可以了。我从没有离开过这里，所以我不知道有什么可以帮忙的。那么，你想知道什么？}

{122}{TAND_5}{我，离开这里？那可真造化了。我不知道怎样一个人离开，而且连个伴都没有。最糟糕的是，我爸爸说如果我出了什么事他会得心脏病的！}
#{123}{}{Tough situation. Can I ask you a few questions, though?}
{123}{}{真是可怜可叹啊，我还可以问你一些问题吗？}

{128}{}{为什么你不离开？}
#{129}{}{Sorry to hear that, but I don't have much time.
 # Can I ask you a few questions?}
{129}{}{很同情，但我的时间有限。我可以问你一些问题吗？}
# {130}{TAND_14}{Finally!  Someone else who

{138}{TAND_20}{我们这里有大蝎子！我知道它不是什么好东西，但是还没人被它们叮死。这是我们这里最刺激的事情了！}
# {139}{TAND_21}{Nothing much, since you whomped those Rad Scorpions. Gee, I
 # wish I could have seen that.}
{139}{TAND_21}{自从你搞定那些大蝎子后，就没什么好玩的了。当时我要是能在现场看你杀蝎子就好了，唉。}

{192}{TAND_51}{我真的远远地见到过一只呢。它们是肮脏的动物，有巨大的爪子和锋利的毒刺，它们的毒即使处理过仍然会致命。你该去问我爸爸，亚拉德什，他知道它们的一些情况。}
# {193}{TAND_52}{I heard a tale from a traveller up from the south.  He said the
