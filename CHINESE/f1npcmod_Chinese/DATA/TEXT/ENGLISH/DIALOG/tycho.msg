#{100}{}{You see a man in dusty leather armor with a trenchcoat and gas mask.}
#{101}{}{You see Tycho.}
#{102}{}{Another new face. Travelers here are a dime a dozen. But you have the
# look of someone different. Care to join me for a drink?}
#{103}{}{Sorry, I'm rather pressed for time.}
#{104}{}{Sure.}
#{105}{}{Duh-wah?}
#{106}{}{Delightful. I hope you don't mind your drink well-watered - they treat
# beer here like it's a potted plant.}
#{107}{}{So, what's your story?}
#{108}{}{Yeah, a drink of water. Never mind.}
#{109}{}{I could ask the same of you. In the interest of amity, I suppose I'll
# tell first. I'm called Tycho. Came from out east, what used to be called Nevada.}
#{110}{}{That's a pretty long trip.}
#{111}{}{How did you survive all the dangers?}
#{112}{}{Yeah, it was. Decided to take it easy for a while. This place shows some
# promise, just as soon as someone cleans up some of the scum.}
#{113}{}{Why don't you?}
#{114}{}{Yeah, I noticed. What do you know about those jerks?}
#{115}{}{Had some pretty good training, and some good weapons, too. My grandfather
# was a Ranger way back when, and he taught my father everything he knew. Dad
# passed it on to me. So I know enough not to drink glowing water, so to speak.}
#{116}{}{Interesting. Thanks for the drink.}
#{117}{}{Really? Survival's tough these days. You must be pretty knowledgeable.}
#{118}{}{Not my place. I'd rather not cross Killian, after all. He'll clean up
# this town when he gets around to it. A good man, mark my words. But watch out
# for that fellow Gizmo. Reminds me of another fat freak my father told me about
# back in Las Vegas.}
#{119}{}{Thanks for the tip, and the drink.}
#{120}{}{There's two grades of scum here. One of 'em's the Skulz, a gang that hangs
# out in back of Marcelles' crash house. They're just grade-B twerps. But the other
# ones answer to a fat freak whose name you can probably guess. Runs the casino.
# Those guys are organized and dangerous.}
#{121}{}{I see. Thanks for the info.}
#{122}{}{Yeah, well, my family taught me everything there is to know about survival.
# Don't drink water that's totally clear and free of insects and moss, for instance.
# Only poisonous or radioactive water would be that clean in the wilderness.
# Lots of other little things to look out for, too.}
#{123}{}{Like what?}
#{124}{}{Well, if you've got some time, I could go over some pointers.}
#{125}{}{Sure, that would be great.}
#{126}{}{Sorry, I'm kind of pressed for time.}
#{127}{}{Whoa, not so fast. We never finished introductions, remember? What's your
# name, stranger?}
#{128}{}{I'm }
#{129}{}{.}
#{130}{}{None of your business, you nut.}
#{131}{}{Good to meet you. Step carefully, friend.}
#{132}{}{Now, now, no need to get impolite. But with that attitude you'd best be
# on your way.}
#{133}{}{Bite me.}
#{134}{}{Whatever. See ya.}
#{135}{}{What do you want?}
#{136}{}{Sorry to disturb your private time. Go wank somewhere else.}
#{137}{}{I need information about the gangers here.}
#{138}{}{I need information about the town.}
#{139}{}{Hello again. How can I help you?}
#{140}{}{Killian's asked me to clean up this town, and I'd like your help.}
#{141}{}{Well, this is the Skum Pitt, a wretched hive of villainy and all that. Just
# west of here is Gizmo's, a big casino. Word is the games are rigged. A little south
# of here is the Crash House, run by Marcelles, where you can get a night's sleep
# for way too many caps. Past that is Killian's. Killian runs a general store, and
# he also enforces the law in this town - a good man. Then south of there you have
# Doc Morbid, whose operation is a little funny, if you take my meaning.}
#{142}{}{I hope that my little instruction course helped a bit.}
#{143}{}{}
#{144}{}{Word out is that you've been having some contacts with Gizmo. I'd step
# carefully around that barrel of lard if I were you.}
#{145}{}{My business is none of yours.}
#{146}{}{Yeah, I work for Gizmo now. What's it to you?}
#{147}{}{Fair enough. But watch your back. Gizmo isn't known for his consideration
# for his employees.}
#{148}{}{Suffice to say that your employer has caused more than enough misery and
# strife in this town. Don't expect much help from anyone, least of all Gizmo.
# Too bad. You might've been able to change this town for the better.}
#{149}{}{What can I do for you?}
#{150}{}{Any recommendations?}
#{151}{}{Thanks for your help. I think it's time to part ways.}
#{152}{}{Yeah, I'd stay the hell away from whatever made that. Seriously, I've never
# seen anything like that. I think our best option is to move on, fast.}
#{153}{}{Very well. I must say that it has been an honor and a pleasure.}
#{154}{}{Watch out for radioactive hot spots. This place obviously sustained a
# direct nuclear strike, and secondary cascade radiation may be bad. I'd
# recommend avoiding this place completely if we can.}
#{155}{}{Note the lack of any animal life for quite a distance. And the piles of
# bones. Whatever lives here is a real beast. Keep your weapon handy.}
#{156}{}{A military place like this must have a central command room somewhere.}
#{157}{}{I bet we could get through those force-field generators with a little
# hot-wiring, or if we could find the force field control computer.}
#{158}{}{There are many strange tales about Necropolis, the city of the dead. Stay
# alert, because it could get dangerous really fast.}
#{159}{}{I need to change formation.}
#{160}{}{What distance do you want me at?}
#{161}{}{Stay close.}
#{162}{}{Keep a moderate distance.}
#{163}{}{Move out to longer range.}
#{164}{}{What sorts of weapon skills have you learned?}
#{165}{}{Pretty good ranger training: I can use a spear, of course, in a pinch;
# I'm also skilled with small pistols and rifles.}
#{166}{}{Uh, never mind.}

{100}{}{你看到一个穿着皮装甲的男人，还穿着一件破外套，戴着防毒面具。}
{101}{}{你看到提可。}
{102}{}{又是新面孔。来这的旅行者很多。可你看起来不大一样。想跟我喝一杯吗？}
{103}{}{抱歉，我赶时间。}
{104}{}{当然。}
{105}{}{哈啥？}
{106}{}{太高兴了。希望你不介意喝井水，他们象浇花一样往啤酒里兑水。}
{107}{}{那么，说说关于你的事。}
{108}{}{好，白水饮料，没关系。}
{109}{}{我也要问你一样的问题。为表示友好，我想我该先说。我叫提可，从东边一个曾被叫做内华达的地方来。}
{110}{}{那可真是很长的一段路。}
{111}{}{你是怎么逃脱那些危险生存下来的？}
{112}{}{是的，的确。当时决定放松一下。这个地方不错，只要有人出来把那群人渣清理掉。}
{113}{}{为什么你不？}
{114}{}{是的，我注意到了，关于那些混球你知道些什么？}
{115}{}{我经历过一些训练，也有好武器。我祖父是个流浪的人，他把他会的一切都教给我爸爸了，我爸爸又教给我。所以我有足够的生存常识。}
{116}{}{很有意思。谢谢你的饮料。}
{117}{}{真的，如今能生存下来的人可是很强的。你肯定很有才。}
{118}{}{这不是我的地方。不管怎样，我都不想惹基利安。时机一到他会清理这地方的。记住，那是个好人。不过要小心吉斯莫那家伙。让我想起我父亲跟我讲过以前在拉斯维加斯也有这么一个死胖子。}
{119}{}{谢谢你的提醒，还有饮料。}
{120}{}{这里有两伙流氓。一伙是骷髅党，在玛塞尔的破屋后面出没的家伙。不过他们只是一般货色。另一伙是响应一个死胖子的，你猜的到那是谁。他们经营赌场。是很有组织而且很危险的家伙。}
{121}{}{知道了，谢谢。}
{122}{}{啊，是的，我的家族教了我一切要用到的生存之道。比如不要喝从昆虫和苔藓那里得到的，看起来完全洁净的水，在野外只有有毒或者受过辐射的水才会那么干净。还有很多这样的细节要小心。}
{123}{}{譬如？}
{124}{}{如果你有时间的话，我能回想起很多。}
{125}{}{当然好了。}
{126}{}{抱歉，我有点赶时间。}
{127}{}{喂，别着急啊。咱们还没互相介绍完呢，记得吗？你叫什么，陌生人。}
{128}{}{我是}
{129}{}{。}
{130}{}{不关你事，白痴。}
{131}{}{很高兴见到你。小心行走，朋友。}
{132}{}{现在，不用以礼相待了。但如果你是这种态度的话还是赶紧走的好。}
{133}{}{咬我呀。}
{134}{}{随便了。再见。}
{135}{}{你想怎样？}
{136}{}{抱歉占用了你的私人时间。滚别处去。}
{137}{}{我需要这里帮派的信息。}
{138}{}{我需要这个镇的信息。}
{139}{}{嘿，又是你。能帮你吗？}
{140}{}{基利安要我清理这个地方，我想得到你的帮忙。}
{141}{}{这是萨姆・匹特，邪恶家伙的据点。西面是吉斯莫的地方，一个大赌场。传闻他们那里都是作弊的。这里南边一点是棚屋区，由玛塞尔掌管，你晚上可以去那里休息，如果你嫌钱多的话。再过去一点是基利安的地方。他有一个商店，还维持这里的秩序，是个好人。还有在南部的莫彼得大夫，他做的手术和那地方都有点奇怪，懂我的意思了吧。}
{142}{}{希望我的介绍能有点帮助。}
{143}{}{}
{144}{}{传闻你跟吉斯莫有接触。如果我是你，在那桶肥油身边做事的话，我会很小心的。}
{145}{}{我的事不要你管。}
{146}{}{对，我现在为吉斯莫做事了，怎样？}
{147}{}{好吧。不过小心点。吉斯莫可不是很照顾手下的人。}
{148}{}{不客气的说，你和你的手下已经给这个镇带来太多冲突和灾难了。除了吉斯莫别指望任何人会帮助你。很不幸。本来你可以为这个镇做些好事的。}
{149}{}{我能帮你点什么？}
{150}{}{有什么好推荐的吗？}
{151}{}{谢谢你的帮忙，我想现在该分开了。}
{152}{}{可不是，我肯定要躲的远远的。说真的，我从来没见过那种东西。对我们来说最好的选择就是继续跑，拼命跑。}
{153}{}{很好。我必须说这是一种荣幸。}
{154}{}{小心那些辐射点。这个地方明显遭到过直接的核打击，遗留辐射仍然会是很强烈的。如果可能的话，我建议彻底远离这个地方。}
{155}{}{这附近都没有动物生存。这还有成堆的骨骸。这住的肯定是个不好对付的野兽。大家拿好武器。}
{156}{}{这样一个军事区域一定有个中心指挥室。}
{157}{}{我们应该可以通过那些力场，如果在那些电线上动点手脚，或者我们要找到控制力场的电脑。}
{158}{}{关于大墓地有很多奇怪的传说，是个死亡之地。保持警惕，危险会在一瞬间逼近。}
{159}{}{我需要变换队型。}
{160}{}{你要我离多远？}
{161}{}{跟紧我。}
{162}{}{保持适中距离。}
{163}{}{离我远些。}
{164}{}{你都会用什么武器？}
{165}{}{我受过很好的流浪者训练，我可以用矛，当然是在没有其他武器可用的时候，手枪和来福枪是我最拿手的。}
{166}{}{啊，没什么。}
