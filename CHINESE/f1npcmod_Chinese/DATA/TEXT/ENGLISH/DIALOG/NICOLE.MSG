#{100}{}{You see Nicole.}
{100}{}{你看见妮可尔。}

#{101}{}{Tell me a little history behind the Followers.}
{101}{}{告诉我有关末世论者的历史。}

#{102}{}{What do you worship?}
{102}{}{你信仰的是什么？}

#{103}{}{What's around here?}
{103}{}{周围有些什么？}

#{104}{}{I have some information for you.}
{104}{}{我有些事要和你说。}

#{105}{Nic_1}{Greetings. Hey! We're very glad you could join us. We hope you have found our humble abode to your satisfaction.}
{105}{Nic_1}{你好。嗨！我们很高兴你能加入。希望我们的陋堂不至于冒犯了你。}

#{106}{}{Thanks. Can you tell me more about what you worship here?}
{106}{}{谢谢。你能告诉我更多有关于你们的信仰吗？}

#{107}{}{'Humble' is a good word. 'Dump' would be better.}
{107}{}{“陋堂”是个好词。不过“垃圾山”更贴切些。}

#{108}{}{I have. Can I ask you a few questions?}
{108}{}{这里还好。我能问你一些问题吗？}

#{109}{}{It's okay, I guess.}
{109}{}{我觉得这里还可以。}

#{110}{}{Nuhh? Uh, nuh, nuh. Huh?}
{110}{}{噢？呃，嗯，嗯，哦？}

#{111}{Nic_2}{We don't worship so much as follow a set of principles. We want to bring peace back to this wasteland. The world tends toward destruction, so we try to make a difference.}
{111}{Nic_2}{我们有信仰，但不拘泥于固有的法则。我们想要为这片废土带来和平。这个世界正走向毁灭，因此，我们正在努力尝试去改变。}

#{112}{}{How?}
{112}{}{怎么去改变？}

#{113}{Nic_4}{We try to remind people why the Great War happened in the first place. And help insure it won't ever happen again.}
{113}{Nic_4}{我们试着去提醒人们，大战是如何开始的。并且确保它不会再次发生。}

#{114}{}{Have you been successful at all?}
{114}{}{成功了吗？}

#{115}{}{Sounds like wishful thinking - not very realistic.}
{115}{}{听起来倒很美－可惜不太现实。}

#{116}{Nic_5}{We never give up hope. We never will, even though most live by the gun these days. And we are concerned with the Children of the Cathedral...}
{116}{Nic_5}{我们绝不放弃希望。即使现在大多数人必须活在枪口下，我们也绝对不会放弃。我们现在尤其担心大教堂的教徒……}

#{117}{}{What about them?}
{117}{}{他们怎样？}

#{118}{Nic_6}{They claim to want peace, like us. But anyone who disagrees with them just disappears. Their Dark God is not what he seems, believe me.}
{118}{Nic_6}{像我们一样他们宣称想要和平，但与他们意见不一的人都消失了。他们的黑暗上帝并不是外表看来那样的，相信我。}

#{119}{}{How do you know?}
{119}{}{你怎么知道的？}

#{120}{}{Don't you think you're being a bit paranoid?}
{120}{}{你不觉得你想象力过于丰富了吗？}

#{121}{}{'Us?' Is this what all the Followers think or just you?}
{121}{}{“我们”？这究竟是末世论者的想法呢，还是只是你的一相情愿？}

#{122}{Nic_7}{Call it instinct. We've seen Morpheus and the Nightkin and they don't look like peace makers to us. Their hospitals and message of peace make them attractive, but we know there's evil there.}
{122}{Nic_7}{称其为直觉吧。我们已经见过了墨菲斯和夜行团，他们在我们看来并不像和平主义者。他们的医院和和平信条使得他们有吸引力，但我们知道那是个邪恶之处。}

#{123}{}{Don't you think you're being a little bit paranoid?}
{123}{}{你不认为自己有点太过偏激了吗？}

#{124}{}{Do you have any clues?}
{124}{}{你有任何线索提供吗？}

#{125}{}{Well, I'll make sure to tell you anything I find out.}
{125}{}{好吧，我保证会告诉你任何我找到的线索。}

#{126}{}{'We' this and 'we' that. Are you trying to put words in everyone's mouths?}
{126}{}{“我们”这个“我们”那个的。你想强奸民意啊？}

#{127}{Nic_8}{Maybe, but it's what kept us alive this long.}
{127}{Nic_8}{可能，但这使得我们活了这么久。}

#{128}{Nic_8a}{We are united. If not, we'll perish. Now forgive me if that irritates you.}
{128}{Nic_8a}{我们团结一致。若非如此，我们便会毁灭。如有冒犯，请原谅。}

#{129}{Nic_8b}{Is there anything else you need to know?}
{129}{Nic_8b}{你还想知道别的什么？}

#{130}{}{Yeah.}
{130}{}{耶。}

#{131}{}{No, thanks. I'll be going now.}
{131}{}{不，谢了。我得走了。}

#{132}{Nic_9}{Ask, and I'll answer if I can.}
{132}{Nic_9}{问吧，只要我能回答。}

#{133}{Nic_10}{We don't have time for questions from the likes of you. My assistant will show you out.}
{133}{Nic_10}{我们没时间来浪费在像你这样的家伙身上。我的助手会带你出去。}

#{134}{Nic_11}{Hey! I don't appreciate that, but I'll overlook it if you apologize.}
{134}{Nic_11}{嘿！我不喜欢你的态度，如果你道歉我就当没看见。}

#{135}{}{I'm sorry I ever talked to you.}
{135}{}{和你说话真是我的错误。}

#{136}{}{Okay, I'm sorry.}
{136}{}{好好好，我很抱歉。}

#{137}{Nic_12}{Fine. We don't have time to baby-sit. Leave us.}
{137}{Nic_12}{很好。我们没时间玩过家家。快走开。}

#{138}{Nic_13}{Apology accepted. Please remember you are a guest here. Now, is there anything else?}
{138}{Nic_13}{我原谅你了。请记住你在这里只是过客。现在，还有别的什么事吗？}

#{139}{}{Can I ask a few more questions?}
{139}{}{我还能问些问题吗？}

#{140}{}{No, I'll be going now.}
{140}{}{不，我得走了。}

#{141}{Nic_14}{We wish you the best in the journeys ahead. Please feel free to use our base as much as you like.}
{141}{Nic_14}{我们希望你的旅程一切顺利。只要你乐意，你可以随时来我们基地休息。}

#{142}{Nic_15}{We know it could be better. But when you're preparing for war...}
{142}{Nic_15}{我们知道那样会更好。但当你准备战斗时……}

#{143}{}{War with who?}
{143}{}{和谁开战？}

#{144}{Nic_16}{The Children of the Cathedral. We believe in bringing peace to the land, but there's some things that just can't be helped.}
{144}{Nic_16}{大教堂的教徒。我们相信能为这块土地带来和平，但是总有一些问题是不能和平解决的。}

#{145}{}{What do you mean? What did they do?}
{145}{}{你的意思是？他们做了什么？}

#{146}{}{Why do you believe in peace?}
{146}{}{为什么您相信和平？}

#{147}{Nic_17}{Ever since the Children showed up, anyone who doesn't believe in their vision disappears. They say that they are here for peace, but we know differently.}
{147}{Nic_17}{自从教徒出现以来，任何不信任他们的人都消失了。他们说他们是为和平而来，但我们知道根本不是那么回事。}

#{148}{}{How do you know?}
{148}{}{你是怎么知道的？}

#{149}{}{So what are you going to do about it?}
{149}{}{那么你打算怎么做？}

#{150}{}{Where did the Children come from?}
{150}{}{教徒是从哪来的？}

#{151}{Nic_18}{All we can do is prepare. But the time will come when we must fight these Children and their Dark God.}
{151}{Nic_18}{我们目前只能严阵以待。但总有一天，我们会和教徒以及他们的黑暗上帝做个了断的。}

#{152}{}{Sounds dangerous. I'll let you know anything I find out.}
{152}{}{听起来很危险。我找到什么会让你知道的。}

#{153}{}{I thought you said you believed in peace?}
{153}{}{我记得你说过你们信仰和平？}

#{154}{Nic_19}{Good! We could use any information. Now, is there anything else you'd like to ask?}
{154}{Nic_19}{太好了！我们需要任何情报。现在你还想问点什么吗？}

#{155}{}{Yes, there is.}
{155}{}{是的，还有点问题。}

#{156}{}{No, thank you.}
{156}{}{不，谢谢你。}

#{157}{Nic_20}{We do believe in peace, but we will defend this land if we have to. If that means the Followers go to war, so be it.}
{157}{Nic_20}{我们崇尚和平，但是在忍无可忍的情况下，我们也会保家卫国的。如果这意味着末世论者参与战争，那就算是吧。}

#{158}{}{Sounds contradictory to me.}
{158}{}{在我听来很矛盾。}

#{159}{}{That's kind of two-faced, isn't it?}
{159}{}{你们可真是两面三刀啊，不是吗？}

#{160}{}{Okay. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{160}{}{好的。我能再问你些问题吗？}

#{161}{Nic_21}{Not really. We came to teach peace, but we will defend ourselves, if necessary. That includes our beliefs}
{161}{Nic_21}{你说的不对。我们布道和平，但我们会在必要的情况下自我防卫。这也是我们信条的一部分。}

#{162}{Nic_21b}{You would not understand.}
{162}{Nic_21b}{你不会了解。}

#{163}{}{Hmm, okay. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{163}{}{恩，好的。我能问你些别的问题吗？}

#{164}{}{All right. I think it's time for me to go.}
{164}{}{好吧。我赶时间得走了。}

#{165}{Nic_22}{They showed up around the same time we did, but no one knows how they came about. We've heard rumors that their leader, Morpheus, was part of the Rippers before he was 'enlightened' by their Dark God.}
{165}{Nic_22}{他们与我们几乎同时出现，但没人知道是怎么来的。我们听说他们的领袖，墨菲斯，在被黑暗上帝“启迪”前是电锯党的成员。}

#{166}{}{Hey, a guy can change.}
{166}{}{嘿，人总是在变的嘛。}

#{167}{}{Sounds like he's not a nice fellow.}
{167}{}{听起来他不是一个好人。}

#{168}{}{I think I'll check it out.}
{168}{}{我想我会去核实的。}

#{169}{Nic_23}{That's a very charitable description. Now, is there anything else?}
{169}{Nic_23}{对他，那是个很客气的描述了。现在，还有别的事吗？}

#{170}{}{Yes, there is.}
{170}{}{是的,有。}

#{171}{}{No, thank you.}
{171}{}{不，谢谢你。}

#{172}{Nic_24}{Be very careful. Of course, we would love to know what's going on over there.}
{172}{Nic_24}{千万小心。当然，我们很迫切地需要知道那里发生了什么。}

#{173}{}{Can I ask a few more questions?}
{173}{}{我能再问些问题吗？}

#{174}{}{Thanks, I'll go now.}
{174}{}{谢了。我得走了。}

#{175}{Nic_25}{We started this group after seeing that bloodshed still ruled the land. There seemed to be no hope left. Man can't live without hope.}
{175}{Nic_25}{当我们看到这个无纪律的土地上充斥着流血，似乎没有任何希望存在，于是我们建立了这个组织。因为人们不能没有希望活着。}

#{176}{}{And you give hope?}
{176}{}{你给予希望？}

#{177}{}{You sound like one of the Children!}
{177}{}{你听起来像那些大教堂的人！}

#{178}{}{When did you start this group?}
{178}{}{你何时开始建立这个组织的？}

#{179}{Nic_26}{We try. We try our best. Most people don't want to listen, but a few do.}
{179}{Nic_26}{我们在尝试。我们在尽全力。大多数人不想听我们的，但有少数愿意。}

#{180}{}{Well, I hope I can ask another question.}
{180}{}{好的，我希望能问些别的问题。}

#{181}{}{It's time for me to leave.}
{181}{}{我得走了。}

#{182}{Nic_27}{I'm sure you'd be bored with the telling of the entire history of the Followers. There a number of books in here with that information.}
{182}{Nic_27}{要是完整地听一遍末世论者的历史，你肯定会感到相当的厌烦。在这里有很多书，它们会告诉你想要的。}

#{183}{}{Can I ask a few more questions?}
{183}{}{我能再问些问题吗？}

#{184}{}{Well, thanks. I need to go now.}
{184}{}{好的，谢谢。我得走了。}

#{185}{Nic_28}{A number of our spies have seen Nightkin coming in and out of the back room of the Children's temple. Something important is back there.}
{185}{Nic_28}{我们的间谍见到夜行团在教堂的密室进进出出。有些重要的东西在那里。}

#{186}{}{Well, I'll report back anything I hear.}
{186}{}{好的，我打听到什么会回来报告的。}

#{187}{}{Can I ask a few more questions?}
{187}{}{我能再问些问题吗？}

#{188}{}{Interesting, but I gotta go.}
{188}{}{很有趣，但我得走了。}

#{189}{Nic_29}{What would you like to know?}
{189}{Nic_29}{你想知道什么？}

#{190}{}{Where did the Followers start?}
{190}{}{末世论者是何时创建的？}

#{191}{}{Who started it?}
{191}{}{是谁创建的？}

#{192}{}{What are your goals?}
{192}{}{你的目标是什么？}

#{193}{Nic_30}{Far to the south, near the Great Glow. The times were hard, but we managed to survive. We realized then the Great War must never happen again.}
{193}{Nic_30}{遥远的南方，靠近闪光之地。那时候很困难，但是我们活了下来。我们意识到，要确保这样的大战不会再发生。}

#{194}{}{So, you started the Followers of the Apocalypse?}
{194}{}{所以，你创建了末世论团体？}

#{195}{}{What made you come up north?}
{195}{}{是什么使得你来北方的？}

#{196}{Nic_31}{After my parents were killed by a marauders, 【sigh】 it was time the killing stopped. It's our goal to make this land the way it used to be, before the war.}
{196}{Nic_31}{在我的父母被掠夺者杀害了后，【叹气】是到杀戮该停止的时候了。我们的目标是使得这大陆恢复到战前。}

#{197}{}{I'm sorry about your parents.}
{197}{}{抱歉提起了你父母的事。}

#{198}{}{So it could happen again? That's stupid!}
{198}{}{也就是说那可能再次发生？那真蠢！}

#{199}{}{Who were the marauders?}
{199}{}{那些掠夺者是谁？}

#{200}{}{What made you bring the Followers up north?}
{200}{}{是什么使你把末世论者带到北方？}

#{201}{Nic_32}{We've never found out, although we've heard a group live up north in an old ruined city. We've let it rest.}
{201}{Nic_32}{虽然没能找出来，但我们听说有个团体住在北边的旧城市废墟中，很可能是他们。我们也没打算去查探。}

#{202}{}{Why not? You could get revenge!}
{202}{}{为什么不？你可以报仇！}

#{203}{}{Why did you end up bringing the Followers north?}
{203}{}{为什么你带着末世论者北上？}

#{204}{Nic_33}{We're here to make peace, not kill in hatred.}
{204}{Nic_33}{我们来此为了和平，不会因为仇恨而去杀人。}

#{205}{}{Sounds more like fear.}
{205}{}{听起来更像是你害怕他们。}

#{206}{}{Very noble of you. If it was me I'd kill them all.}
{206}{}{你很高尚。若是我的话就会把他们都杀了。}

#{207}{}{Why are you up here now?}
{207}{}{为什么你现在在这里？}

#{208}{Nic_34}{I'm not surprised. The Followers are here to talk sense into people like you.}
{208}{Nic_34}{我并不感到惊讶。末世论者到这来就是为了劝导像你这样的人。}

#{209}{}{Good luck, it's a tough sell. Is that why you're up north now?}
{209}{}{祝好运，那真是不容易。那是你现在为何北上的原因吗？}

#{210}{}{And you don't think violence is ever good?}
{210}{}{你从不认为暴力有时候也是好事？}

#{211}{}{Then answering more questions can't hurt, right?}
{211}{}{那么你就再回答一些问题好吗？}

#{212}{}{Well, I gotta go.}
{212}{}{好吧，我得走了。}

#{213}{Nic_35}{【Sigh】 You're simply not ready to understand the differences. Okay. So why don't you just think about it, then come back to talk.}
{213}{Nic_35}{【叹气】你只是不愿意理解其中的差异罢了。好了。你为什么不好好想一想，然后回来我们再说。}

#{214}{Nic_36}{There aren't many left down south. The radiation has polluted almost everything. Most of the remaining people followed us to start the organization.}
{214}{Nic_36}{南方没有太多人存活下来。放射线污染到处都是。活下来的多数人追随我们组建了这个组织。}

#{215}{}{How did your family survive?}
{215}{}{你的家庭是怎么幸存下来的？}

#{216}{}{It's still that radioactive? After 80 years?}
{216}{}{那里仍旧有辐射吗？在８０年后？}

#{217}{Nic_37}{We lived on the outskirts of the Great Glow. Sickness had started spreading, so we gathered all the people and we made our way north. 【Sigh】 That's when my parents were killed.}
{217}{Nic_37}{我们住在闪光之地的附近。疾病开始漫延，于是我们聚集了所有的人来到北方，【叹气】那时我的双亲被杀害了。}

#{218}{}{I'm sorry.}
{218}{}{我很抱歉。}

#{219}{}{Why is the area down there still that radioactive after all this time?}
{219}{}{为什么那里经过了这么长的时间还有放射线？}

#{220}{Nic_39}{Thank you, I appreciate that. Now, is there anything else you needed to ask me?}
{220}{Nic_39}{谢谢你，我很感激。现在，你还有别的什么想问我吗？}

#{221}{}{Yes, there is.}
{221}{}{是的，有。}

#{222}{}{No, I need to run.}
{222}{}{不，我得走了。}

#{223}{Nic_41}{Well, the rumor is that there was something so important there, that the area was saturated with bombs to insure everything was wiped out.}
{223}{Nic_41}{呃，听说那里有些很重要的设施，所以核弹的投放很密集以确保那里的所有东西都被摧毁。}

#{224}{}{Can I ask a few more questions?}
{224}{}{我能问些别的问题吗？}

#{225}{}{Interesting. But I have to go now.}
{225}{}{很有意思。但我现在得走了。}

#{226}{Nic_42}{Well, the Boneyard is pretty scarce as you can see. Adytum is to the west. The Children of the Cathedral are to the north. I wouldn't advise going too far south into the city, though, the Rippers and the Blades have made it into a battlefield.}
{226}{Nic_42}{呃，晒骨场的各个地区是很松散的。内城区在西方。大教堂教徒在北方。我要劝你不要往南方的城区走太远了，电锯党和利刃帮在那里恶斗。}

#{227}{Nic_43}{About what?}
{227}{Nic_43}{关于什么？}

#{228}{}{I know what's behind the Children of the Cathedral.}
{228}{}{我知道大教堂教徒的阴谋是什么。}

#{229}{}{How much are you willing to pay me?}
{229}{}{你愿意付我多少钱？}

#{230}{}{Nothing, never mind.}
{230}{}{没什么，没事。}

#{231}{Nic_44}{Finally! What'd you find out?}
{231}{Nic_44}{终于！你找到了什么？}

#{232}{}{I'm now the leader of the Children!}
{232}{}{我现在是教徒的领袖了！}

#{233}{}{Morpheus is not the leader of the Children. It's actually run by the Master.}
{233}{}{墨菲斯并不是教徒的领袖，事实上主教才是。}

#{234}{}{You know the Nightkin?}
{234}{}{你知道夜行团吗？}

#{235}{Nic_45}{Wait a s...the Dark God? You're not telling me he's real.}
{235}{Nic_45}{等一下……黑暗上帝？别跟我说他真的存在。}

#{236}{}{Oh, he's real all right, just not a god. He's a mutant who wants to make everyone a Nightkin, for their own good.}
{236}{}{哦，他真的存在，只是不是神。他是一个变种人，为了自己的利益，想把所有人都变成夜行团。}

#{237}{}{Yes, he is! You should fear the all-mighty Dark God!}
{237}{}{是的，就是他！您应该恐惧的具有强大势力的黑暗上帝！}

#{238}{Nic_46}{What do the Nightkin have to do with this?}
{238}{Nic_46}{夜行团和这事有什么关系？}

#{239}{}{They're actually a race of super mutants. The Master is their leader.}
{239}{}{他们实际上是个超级变种人种族。主教是他们的领袖。}

#{240}{Nic_47}{What do they plan to do? }
{240}{Nic_47}{他们计划做什么？}

#{241}{}{The Master wants to make everyone a Nightkin. He thinks they're superior, and he thinks that turning everyone into them will save humanity!}
{241}{}{主教想把每个人都变成夜行团。他认为他们更高等，而且他认为将人转化后才能保存人类！}

#{242}{}{I'm not sure. I just know that the Master is turning people into Nightkin.}
{242}{}{我不确定。我只知道主教正在将人变成夜行团。}

#{243}{Nic_49}{What should we do?}
{243}{Nic_49}{我们应该做什么？}

#{244}{}{I'm going to talk to the Master.}
{244}{}{我要和主教谈谈。}

#{245}{}{I'm going to take out the Cathedral right now.}
{245}{}{我现在就去除掉大教堂。}

#{246}{}{I've destroyed the place where they make more Super Mutants, but I need help in taking out the Cathedral.}
{246}{}{我已经摧毁了制造超级变种人的地方，但我需要帮助才能摧毁大教堂。}

#{247}{Nic_50}{We can't let this opportunity pass. You scout the Cathedral. We'll meet you there and help you storm the place.}
{247}{Nic_50}{我们不能失去这次机会。你去侦察大教堂。我们在里面和你会合，然后消灭那个地方。}

#{248}{}{No, not that. Do you know if there's a secret way in?}
{248}{}{不，这样不妥。你知道哪里有秘道吗？}

#{249}{}{Okay. Meet me there.}
{249}{}{好吧。在那里见我。}

#{250}{}{No! I don't want anyone else to be hurt.}
{250}{}{不！我不想有任何人受到伤害。}

#{251}{Nic_52a}{No, but I know someone who will. Go to the Cathedral and find a woman named Laura. Tell her 'Red Rider'. We'll create a diversion if we can.}
{251}{Nic_52a}{我不知道，但我知道有个人，可能她会知道。去大教堂找个叫劳拉的女人。告诉她“红骑士”这个暗号。我们会尽可能的牵制敌人。}

#{252}{}{Thanks. I hope luck is with us.}
{252}{}{谢谢。我希望好运常伴我们。}

#{253}{Nic_53}{Luck has nothing to do with it. I have faith in you.}
{253}{Nic_53}{运气不是绝对的。我对你有信心。}

#{254}{Nic_56}{Our destiny lies before us. Let us hope we are worthy.}
{254}{Nic_56}{命运就在眼前。要看我们的能耐了。}

#{255}{Nic_57}{What? This is our destiny. The Followers will fight this evil so that the healing of the land can finally begin.}
{255}{Nic_57}{什么？这是我们的命数。末世论者将会与这邪恶势力作战到底，努力使大陆最终慢慢复原。}

#{256}{}{No. I forbid it.}
{256}{}{不。我不允许你草率行事。}

#{257}{}{Okay. Meet me at the Cathedral.}
{257}{}{好。在大教堂会合。}

#{258}{Nic_58}{【Chuckle】 You don't control us. We will attack, with or without your blessing!}
{258}{Nic_58}{【吃吃地笑】你又控制不了我们。我们会发动攻击，无论有没有你的帮助！}

#{259}{Nic_59}{Talk to him?! Are you crazy?}
{259}{Nic_59}{和他谈？！你疯了吗？}

#{260}{}{Aren't you the one that preaches peace?}
{260}{}{你不是鼓吹和平的吗？}

#{261}{}{No, and you can't stop me.}
{261}{}{我没疯，你不能阻止我。}

#{262}{Nic_60}{Well, yes, but...}
{262}{Nic_60}{呃，好吧，但……}

#{263}{}{I think I can end this without bloodshed. Be ready, though, in case I fail.}
{263}{}{我想我可以和平解决这事。但是，做好准备，以防万一我失败。}

#{264}{Nic_61a}{Obviously, your mind is made up. This might help you. Go to the Cathedral and find a woman named Laura. Say the phrase 'Red Rider'. And please...come back safely.}
{264}{Nic_61a}{显然，你已经下定决心了。我还可以帮你一下，去大教堂找一个叫做劳拉的女人。说暗语“红骑士”。请……安全地回来。}

#{265}{Nic_63}{You have a strange sense of humor. Why don't you come back when you have something serious to say.}
{265}{Nic_63}{你有很强的幽默感。等你会认真的说话之后再回来。}

#{266}{}{Sorry, it was just a joke. It has to do with the Nightkin.}
{266}{}{抱歉，那只是个玩笑。这与夜行团有关。}

#{267}{Nic_65a}{So you're a mercenary. Fine, I'll give you 100 caps.}
{267}{Nic_65a}{这么说你是个佣兵类型的人了。很好，我给你１００个瓶盖。}

#{268}{Nic_66b}{Now, what do you have for me?}
{268}{Nic_66b}{现在，你为我带来什么？}

#{269}{}{I know someone is planning to con you out of some money. Thanks.}
{269}{}{我确信某人正在计划诈骗你的钱财。完毕，谢谢。}
