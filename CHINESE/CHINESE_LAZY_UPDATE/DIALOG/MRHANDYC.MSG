{100}{}{这是个失效的机器人。从上边的一层灰尘来看它最近都没动过。}
{101}{}{The robot is now powered on, but is still not functional.}
{102}{}{The hardware doesn't appear to be the problem; it must be a software issue.}
{103}{}{你不能访问机器人的系统，因为它被禁用了。}
{104}{}{你胡乱修复故障部分，但是需要更多的时间来修复。}
{105}{}{你重新启动了机载电脑，而且顺利的重新启动了机器人。你注意到机器人的无线电设备坏掉了。}
{106}{}{你在这个机器人电脑上花了很多时间，但是没有让它重新启动。}
{107}{}{462号单位在线。测试。调整单元位置数据。修复。重新建立存储文件。修复。错误－任务未完成。}
{108}{}{诺嘎。}
{109}{}{什么是任务未完成？}
{110}{}{很好，该干什么干什么，别妨碍我！}
{111}{}{【点击】搞定！重新启动任务。}
{112}{}{462号单位是一个清洁模式。必须完成本层的清洁和维护。}
{113}{}{立刻去执行！}
{114}{}{你要清理什么地方？}
{115}{}{病毒槽控制室。【点击】结束列表。}
{116}{}{Heh, okay. Finish your task.}
{117}{}{因为完成了一个小的清洁工作，你获得了1000点经验值。}

# Fallout Fixt

{118}{}{That does nothing of interest.}
{119}{}{This Mr. Handy robot is in moderate condition, but appears fully functional.}
#
#  120 TRANSLATION NOTE: "Jury-rig" is a nautical term that's come into common use to mean "fix acceptably with the tools at hand" or "a temporary but functional workaround fix"
#
{120}{}{You jury-rig the robot's radio system; it should be usable now.}
{121}{}{You successfully replace the robot's radio.}
{122}{}{The interface systems are not responding to your input.}
{123}{}{The robot's radio is broken.}
#
{124}{}{Hold off on that for a moment. What functions can you perform?}
{125}{}{Unit #462 assists with duties as specified by memory files and programming.}
{126}{}{Yeah, yeah, skip to the interesting parts.}
{127}{}{Could you be more specific?}
{128}{}{[Click] Unit #462 can perform nuclear reactor fuel core replacements, hazardous materials cleanup, radiation cleansing, and basic mechanical repair procedures.}
{129}{}{Anything else?}
{130}{}{[Beep!] Unit #462 is also equipped with self-maintenance routines, self-defense mechanisms, and a fully customizable operating system.}
{131}{}{Self-defense mechanisms?}
{132}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{133}{}{[Click] Unit #462 is authorized to commit deadly force in preservation of itself, as permitted by prior programming.}
{134}{}{Deadly force?}
{135}{}{(A speaker crackles to life, and a recorded message of a male voice begins playing. It sounds like an advertisement.) "RobCo is committed to your safety and well-being. All RobCo Mister Handy units are equipped with state-of-the-art safety overrides, to prevent any unfortunate incidents. Rest assured, Mr. Handy is the best and safety investment your family will ever make." (The speaker shuts off.)}
{136}{}{[Continue]}
{137}{}{[Click] Processing... [Click] Memory file data indicates that as of Unit #462's manufacture date, out of 4,628 recorded self-defense events initiated by similar Units, only 930 have resulted in deaths of unarmed civilians.}
{138}{}{Uh... That doesn't sound very good.}
{139}{}{Hmm. I could use some help cleaning up this place, if you get my drift. Could you help me out?}
{140}{}{Can the self-defense system be reprogrammed into a combat system?}
{141}{}{I think Vault-Dwellers would be considered civilians, so I'll do my best to not piss you off.}
{142}{}{[Click] Checking... [Click] Unit #462's programming is not currently configured to allow such assistance. Ownership transfers and weapons system reallocations not permitted under current protocols.}
{143}{}{[Try to hack the unit and bypass the programming protocols]}
{144}{}{(It takes you a while, but you're finally able to crack the codes and get root access to the system.)}
{145}{}{[Beep!] Unit #462 online. Self-test... OK. Adjusting unit location data. Fixed. Rebuilding memory file. Fixed. Clearing task list... Done. [Click] Command?}
{146}{}{Follow me and keep self-defense mechanisms active at all times. Oh, and don't shoot me, I'm not a threat. So you should probably add that to the self-defense protocols as well.}
{147}{}{[Click] Okey-dokey! Recursive task created. Terminating input.}
{148}{}{(You try to get root access to the system but fail. Lights begin flashing on the unit. Uh-oh...}
{149}{}{Alert! Alert! Threat detected! [Click] Initiating self-defense protocols.}
{150}{}{The robot ignores you and continues on its task.}
{151}{}{Unit #462, at your service.}
