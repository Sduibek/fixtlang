{100}{}{你看见山谬，内城区中拾荒者的一员。}
{101}{}{你看见一个穿着暗蓝色衣服的邋遢男人。}
{102}{}{嘿，我不认为我见过你。你是？}
{103}{}{我是}
{104}{}{。}
{105}{}{你是谁？}
{106}{}{呃？}
{107}{}{很高兴见到你。我叫做山谬。}
{108}{}{你在这里做什么？}
{109}{}{很高兴见到你。}
{110}{}{我不是什么重要的人。不要在意。}
{111}{}{我是一个拾荒者――一个捡垃圾的。我的工作是找出晒骨场中那些还利用价值的东西。这是很危险的工作。}
{112}{}{为什么危险？}
{113}{}{你怎么躲开死亡爪？}
{114}{}{你侦查过其他的区域吗？}
{115}{}{谢谢你，再见。}
{116}{}{再见，如果你能见到我的话。呵呵。}
{117}{}{外面有死亡爪，内城区这里还有管理者。两者都不是好对付的。}
{118}{}{你怎么躲开死亡爪？}
{119}{}{你侦查过其他的区域吗？}
{120}{}{谢谢你，再见。}
{121}{}{我们只在夜晚工作，而且我们的专业技术很过硬。但我承认并不是每个人都总能安全地回来。上个星期我派出一个家伙去为麦尔斯找一些零件，从那之后我们就再没见到过他。我听到的最后一个消息是他找到了那些零件，正在回来的路上。}
{122}{}{我做了一些侦查。你想知道关于谁的消息？}
{123}{}{利刃帮的。}
{124}{}{死亡爪的。}
{125}{}{军火商的。}
{126}{}{末世论者信徒的。}
{127}{}{大教堂教徒的。}
{128}{}{不必了，谢谢。}
{129}{}{利刃帮是一群相当不开眼的人。他们中那些不愿听从管理者命令的人都死在这了。}
{130}{}{你最好别想见它们。这些家伙简直像地狱里的恶魔一样邪恶，它们除了杀死我们这些可怜的拾荒者以外就没有什么喜欢做的事情了。}
{131}{}{我听说在利刃帮东边的某处有他们的一个巢穴，但我本人没有见过。}
{132}{}{不久之前军火商搬到东北方向的一个大工厂去了。我不能告诉你太多，因为他们有一条流淌着放射性泥浆的护城河，而且你必须越过死亡爪的地盘才能到那里。}
{133}{}{那些末世论者鼓吹和平与宽容。虽然主意不错，不过不可能实行。他们住在西北方向的一个大图书馆里。}
{134}{}{大教堂教徒的基地在从这里向南一段路的一个大教堂里。那里在进行一些奇怪的事。我看到一些非人类的生物在那里出出进进的。}
{135}{}{而且如果传说准确的话，那个教堂是在一座古老的避难所基础上改建的，内城区居民早先就住在那个避难所里。}
{136}{}{你好，我们又见面了。发生什么了？}
{137}{}{能再告诉我一次你的工作吗？}
{138}{}{没事，谢谢。}
{139}{}{哦，我知道了。对。再见！}

{140}{}{Miles said I should talk to you about parts for his hydroponic farms. Do you know anything about that?}
{141}{}{Ah, yes. As a matter of fact I do. Last week I sent a guy up north to look for the parts for Miles, but we haven't heard from him since. The last transmission I got from him was that he'd found the parts, and was on his way back. I haven't had time to check on it personally yet, and I don't want to lose another person to whatever may have caused his disappearance.}
{142}{}{Tough break, sorry to hear it. Thanks for the info. Bye.}
{143}{}{If I can get any info on your guy, is there some kind of finder's fee?}
{144}{}{Great, thank you. I'll search in that area for the parts. I'll let you know if I find your missing friend.}
{145}{}{Any time. Seeya.}
{146}{}{Would you? That'd be great. Like I said, things have been busy here and we can't afford to be losing more people.}
{147}{}{(He laughs.) No, not really. If I had the caps for that I'd already have hired someone to track him down. (He thinks for a moment.) I like your spirit, though. Tell you what, if you can find him, I'll see what I can do for you.}
{148}{}{Good news, I found your guy. Bad news, he's very dead.}
{149}{}{I'm sorry to tell you this, but it appears your friend was killed by the Deathclaws at the warehouse.}
{150}{}{Damn! *sigh* I figured as much. Thanks.}
{151}{}{Oh, that's right. Here's your reward. (He hands you what looks like a hand-held miniature chainsaw.) There used to be a gang here that used these. Feel free to kill some of those bastard Deathclaws with it. See'ya 'round.}
{152}{}{Here, take this for the trouble, it's the least I can do. (He hands you 200 caps.)}
