{102}{}{你好，需要我帮忙吗？}
{103}{}{我受伤了。}
{104}{}{我被辐射了。}
{105}{}{你会做手术吗？}
{106}{}{再跟我说说有关手术的事。}
{107}{}{You fix?}
{108}{}{你受伤了？让我看看……}
{109}{}{问题在这里。好了。以后在外面要小心些。}
{110}{}{对不起，如果你不跟我说哪里不对，我是帮不了你的。}
{111}{}{你看起来很好。}
{112}{}{好了。我希望你觉得好点了。}
{113}{}{There you go, but stop getting into so many fights!}
{114}{}{That should do, all fixed up.}
{115}{}{焕然一新。}
{116}{}{All better!}
{117}{}{辐射是非常危险的；你应该更小心些。}
{118}{}{我没时间玩游戏。}
{119}{}{不过当然了，这是非常昂贵和花时间的。}
{120}{}{详细情况？}
{121}{}{好了，没关系。}

{147}{}{很抱歉，如果你没钱我就不能帮你了。}

{502}{}{What other operations can you perform?}
{503}{}{Well, technically I'm not supposed to talk about this, but we do have other procedures available. I warn you that some of them are very dangerous and have a risk of side-effects, while others are quite safe, but have an extremely long recovery time. Would you like more information?}
#Poison examine
{504}{}{Ah yes, let me see here...}

#Sex

{300}{}{Cute, but I'm not interested. Come back if you need medical attention.}
{301}{}{No offense honey, but you're a little below my standards. I'm flattered though.}
{302}{}{Oh, thank you so much. (She blushes) I don't really get any compliments. Being a Brotherhood Doctor is mostly just a stressful, thankless job. I like to joke around, to keep myself entertained and upbeat.}
{303}{}{I understand. Wouldn't it help to blow off some steam once in a while?}
{304}{}{You're welcome. Bye!}
{305}{}{Well... I do get lonely sometimes, and you don't get any 'vacation time' when you're the only doctor in the Brotherhood. Oh, what am I saying though? This is so silly.}
{306}{}{You should suck it up. Take pride in your work and the rest will follow.}
{307}{}{Life's short and then you die. Don't you want to enjoy it while it lasts?}
{308}{}{It's not silly at all. (Lightly touch her face, then lean in and kiss her)}
{309}{}{Yes, I suppose you're right. (She shakes her head and sighs, then recomposes and smiles) Well, back to work! Thank you for the compliment.}
{310}{}{(She thinks for a moment) You're right. And I do. Give me about ten minutes - I need to prep the exam table. (She smiles devilishly and bites her lower lip)}
{311}{}{(She takes your hand and leads you to her room...)}
{312}{}{That was beautiful. I... I think I'm in love with you. (She giggles) Just kidding! Alright, time to go. I have work to do.}
{313}{}{Oh wow. I haven't been fucked like that in years. I think I'm going to be sore for a week, but it was worth it. (She looks at you longingly) Let's do this again soon!}
{315}{}{Definitely. See you later.}
{314}{}{Hey there, gorgeous. Looking to have some more fun?}
{316}{}{What are you do- ... (She is startled at first, but quickly melts to your embrace and kisses you back tenderly, moaning softly. As your kissing becomes more passionate, she stops and pulls away) Come with me. (She stands and leads you to her quarters...)}
{317}{}{Yes! You make me feel so beautiful and wanted.}
{318}{}{(She smiles and takes your hand...)}
{319}{}{Well, I do need some brushing up on my anatomy lessons... (She winks)}
