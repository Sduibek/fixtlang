# 100 "You see" isn't necessary here. Game engine already generates "You see: Izo."
# 100 is the Examine (Binoculars) message.
{100}{}{他拥有功夫高手的体格和风范。}
# Trying to talk to Izo
{101}{}{Izo says nothing. He is watching you carefully with a gaze that makes you uncomfortable.}
# "Izo" is used here instead of "He" because there's no other context during the dialog; just these lines at the initiation of dialog window.
{102}{}{(Izo gives you your money)}
{103}{}{(Izo motions to the door, makes a throat-cutting gesture, and shakes his head.)}
{104}{}{Thanks.}
{105}{}{Duhh...}
{106}{}{(Izo motions to the door.)}
