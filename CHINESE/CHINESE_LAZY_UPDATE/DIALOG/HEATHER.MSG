{101}{}{你在干什么？}

# moronic line for This

{103}{}{再见。}
# moronic line for "Goodbye".

{104}{}{随便看看。}
{105}{}{我来取你性命。}
{106}{}{只是好奇这里怎么了？}
{107}{}{真的？你想找什么？}
{108}{}{我想我找到她了。}
{109}{}{我在找一个奸细。}
{110}{}{真的没什么。只是随便逛逛。}
{111}{}{只是想打听些消息。}
{112}{}{多谢，但是我已经与人有约了，你还是走吧。}
# "I am already spoken for" == "i am already dating someone else"

{113}{}{没错，奸细。我听说过那些讨厌的家伙。希望我们能抓住他。}
# Spy is considered male

{114}{}{我一直听说那个奸细是女的。}

{115}{}{你有曾听说过这个奸细吗？}
# spy is considered male

{116}{}{你就是那个奸细！}
# spy is considered female

{117}{}{祝你好运。抱歉打扰你了。}
{118}{}{我敢打赌是那个爱吹牛的尼尔胡扯了这么多。我得空得和他谈谈。}
# Neil is male

{119}{}{你认为尼尔是奸细？}
# spy is male. Neil is male.

{120}{}{那你认为谁会是奸细？}
# spy is male

{121}{}{听起来你有所隐瞒。为什么？}
{122}{}{这一点我基本上能确定了。只是需要多一点证据。}
{123}{}{我会给你证据的。}
{124}{}{他看起来是个不错的人。我不太清楚。}
{125}{}{为什么你认为是他？}
{126}{}{多谢，你不清楚这对我意味着什么。一旦你找到证据，就杀了他。}
{127}{}{再明显不过了。他能进入大教堂。夜里别人进入梦乡的时候，他出来活动。肯定就是他。}
# Children is short for Children of the Cathedral. Religous cult who believe in destroying
# anyone who gets in their way or acts against their wishes. They are really bad people.
# consider Male.

{128}{}{好的，我会好好查查的。}
{129}{}{算了。我看你只是逗我玩儿！}
{130}{}{你那么想真让我遗憾。我可不能让人认为我是奸细。我得杀了你。}
# Spy is female. "I will remove you from service" == "i am going to have to kill you now"

{131}{}{他在晚上进入大教堂。没人看到他在值班。肯定是他。}

{132}{}{好的，我会好好查查的。}

{134}{}{我不太肯定那是谁。我想可能是卫兵或者学者。他们老是在夜里溜进大教堂。}
# Guard is considered male. Scholar is considered female.
# Children is short for Children of the Cathedral. Religous cult who believe in destroying

{135}{}{你还能想到些什么？}

{136}{}{可我以前听说只有哨兵袭击大教堂教徒。}
# scouts is male
# Children is short for Children of the Cathedral. Religous cult who believe in destroying
# anyone who gets in there way or acts against thier wishes. They are really bad people.
# consider Male.

{137}{}{好的。多谢你的帮助。}
{138}{}{不太肯定。我只觉得是个男的，可能是个学者或者卫兵。}
# is is refering to a male spy. Scholar and guard are male.

{139}{}{Ok。多谢你的帮助。}
{140}{}{没错。我们哨兵多次袭击了大教堂，最终损失了很多人。这个奸细把我们害惨了。}
# scouts is male. spy is male.
# Children is short for Children of the Cathedral. Religous cult who believe in destroying

{141}{}{看起来你被他气疯了。我会找到这个奸细杀了他的。}
# "you seem really torn up about this." == "you seem emotionally distraught over this"
# spy == male

{142}{}{奸细有没有可能是个哨兵？}
# spy and scout == male

{143}{}{谢谢你帮忙。}
{144}{}{我们的人为什么会那么干？}
#us referres to the scouts

{145}{}{如果你杀了所有哨兵，就再没有袭击了。}
{146}{}{我不知道。你为什么那么做？}
{147}{}{不知道。只是好奇。}
{148}{}{听起来主意不错。我发现彼得从来都是在袭击中安然无恙。我想可能他是。}
# Peter is male. She thinks that Peter may be the male spy.

{149}{}{好的，我会好好查查的。}
{150}{}{算了。我看你只是逗我玩儿！}
{151}{}{你觉得我是？}
# it referring to the female spy.

{152}{}{抱歉，我有点儿紧张。}
# under a bit of stress.

{153}{}{对！你去死吧！}
{154}{}{那到其他地方转悠吧。我还有活儿干。}
# then think about it somewhere else

{155}{}{我看他认为我是奸细。可我不是。}
# spy is female

{156}{}{他可能是对的。}
{157}{}{为什么他会那么认为？}
{158}{}{因为我是新来的哨兵。我刚来没一年，五个月前事情开始发生了。}
# scout is female

{159}{}{我看尼尔可能没错。}
# Neil is male. right == correct.

{160}{}{我看尼尔可能是奸细。我会查查的。}
# spy is male.

{161}{}{那就到别的地儿去。别在这儿杵着。}
{162}{}{如果你想打听点儿什么的话去找尼可儿。她自认通天晓。}
# Nicole is female. said in a snotty manner.

{163}{}{如果你肯付钱的话，我倒是乐意告诉你些事情。}
{164}{}{开个价？}
{165}{}{你出售秘密？}
{166}{}{算了。我没钱。}
{167}{}{300块。}
{168}{}{当然。}
{169}{}{没门儿。}
{170}{}{大教堂的据点的最南边会有一场袭击。现在快去。}
{171}{}{想耍我？给你点颜色看看！}
{172}{}{很遗憾你那么想。不过还是祝你愉快。}
{173}{}{不管怎样，我得过去。那么，还想打听些什么？}
# do you want me to give you the information?

{174}{}{当然。}
{175}{}{没门儿。}
{176}{}{没事儿。这就走。}
{177}{}{对不起。我得休息了。}
