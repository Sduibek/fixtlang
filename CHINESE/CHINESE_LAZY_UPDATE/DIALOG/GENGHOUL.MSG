# Examining the ghouls, restored from original Fallout files

{200}{}{你检查了这个可怜的东西，但是并没有发现是什么让它变成了这样。}
{201}{}{它看来似乎曾经是人类，至少是人类后裔。你猜躯体上的性状很可能是酸或辐射所致。}
{202}{}{这具类人的躯体看上去被大剂量照射过，但是生理机能仍然在运作。尽管曾经属于人类，它看来似乎已经返祖为更具兽性的生命形态。}
{203}{}{这具类人的躯体看上去被大剂量照射过，许多肌肉和脑组织看起来似乎已经退化。但是基因指示剂让你相信它就和你一样，是那些进入避难所的居民后裔。}
{204}{}{This pitiful thing is highly irradiated. You cannot determine whether it has gone mad from being caged, or has simply lost too much brain matter due to radiation damage.}
{205}{}{The body of the humanoid looks to be highly irradiated, however it has maintained enough brain matter and motor function to be able to speak clearly.}
