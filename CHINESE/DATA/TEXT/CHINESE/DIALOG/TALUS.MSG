# {105}{}{Chagga!}
{105}{}{查格!}
# {106}{}{That would be the council of elders. More specifically, the
 # High Elder, Maxson. The elders make all the major decisions
 # around here. If you need to speak with them, you'll find them
 # on the fourth floor.}
{106}{}{那可能是议会元老。确切的说，是最高元老，马克松。元老制定这里所有的规则。如果你想和他们谈话，那就去四层。}
# {107}{}{So what do you do?}
{107}{}{那么你想干什么？}
# {108}{}{No, we are directed by the council of elders. Maxson, the High

# {109}{}{I really need some better firepower.}
{109}{}{我真的需要更好的武器。}

# {115}{}{Really? Okay, thanks.}
{115}{}{真的？好的，谢谢。}
# {116}{}{In a hurry, are we? As an Initiate, you are entitled to a few
 # things. I'll put in a clearance for combat armor and three orders
 # for ammunition, bullets of your choice. Just see Michael in the
 # next room for the supplies.}
{116}{}{这么急，不会吧？作为新兵，你会得到一些装备。我会给你一件战斗装甲和三件武器，以及一些弹药。去隔壁的军需官迈克尔那里领装备吧。}
# {117}{}{I am very grateful, but do you by any chance have a weapon you

# {122}{}{That sounds great. Why don't you start now.}
{122}{}{听起来不错。为什么你现在不去呢。}
# {123}{}{Well, I might be able to make an exception. You obviously have
 # some good training. If you didn't you wouldn't have succeeded
 # in that crazy quest the High Elder sent you on.}
{123}{}{好吧，我可以破例一次。你显然受到专业训练。如果你不能完成最高元老那变态的任务的话。}
# {124}{}{Sometimes I don't know if he's trying to get help from the
 # outside, or kill off the stupid. No offense. I'll tell you
 # what. I'm sort of in a tight spot because the scouts I

{124}{}{有时我真不知道他是需要寻求帮助，还是消灭了那些白痴。不是冒犯你。我会告诉你一切。我正处于紧要关头因为我派出去的侦察兵再也没有回来。}
# {125}{}{It was my idea, and I'm sort of taking some heat for it.

# {136}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{136}{}{不，谢谢。}

{140}{}{谢谢，那些高科技武器如何？}
# {141}{}{Well, we are all important, but I know who you are referring to.}
{141}{}{好的，我们都是重要人物，但我知道你说的是谁。}
# {142}{}{That's not a problem. You should get to know your fellow Brothers
 # well. I know there are a lot of us, and that it can be hard
 #for some to remember us all.}
{142}{}{那不是问题。你应该去了解一下你的伙伴。我知道那里有我们很多人，要全都记住并不容易。}
# {143}{}{There's Rhombus. He's our Head Paladin, also known as the Master

# {156}{}{Okay, see ya.}
{156}{}{好的，再见。}
# {157}{}{Maxson is one tough old man. He's the great, great grandson . . .

{189}{}{现在就给我！}
# {190}{}{Sounds good. Bye.}
{190}{}{听起来不错。再见。}
# {191}{}{I shouldn't say, but it's not a weapon. It's something that only
