{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}
#{100}{}{You see the Caravan Driver.}
{100}{}{你看到商队的车夫。}
#{101}{}{Did you want to return to the Hub? I'll pay you another 400 scripts.}
{101}{}{你想跟我们返回哈勃城吗？我可以再付你400块。}
#{102}{}{Rutger should be pleased; we made it without any casualties. Did you
# want to come back with us? We're almost ready to go. The pay will be
# another 400 scripts.}
{102}{}{罗格尔会很高兴的。我们未损一人。你想跟我们回去吗？我们马上就走了。我会再付你400块。}
#{103}{}{That was easier than I expected. Are you coming back with us?
# I'm sure another 400 scripts would come in handy.}
{103}{}{路上比我想像中要简单。你想跟我们回去吗？我会付你400块。}
#{104}{}{That wasn't too bad. If you want to come back with us to the Hub,
# you're welcome to. We'll pay you another 400 scripts.}
{104}{}{一路上还算顺利。如果你想随我们回哈勃城，我们很欢迎，我会再付你400块。}
#{105}{}{It's always a shame to lose someone. Rutger isn't going to take
# this well, but we could use your help getting back. Are you interested?
# Pay's still 400 scripts.}
{105}{}{路上死了人总让人遗憾。罗格尔可能会不高兴的，但我们回去还用的着你。有兴趣吗？报酬还是400块。}
#{106}{}{Damn! I hate losing good guards. We've got to be more careful
# on our way back. We've got to cover each other. We can't let this
# happen again. I'll pay you another 400 scripts. Up for it?}
{106}{}{他妈的，我最不愿意损失能干的护卫。回去路上我们要小心。要互相掩护，不能再让这种事发生。我会再给你400块，有兴趣吗？}
#{107}{}{Are you able to come back to the Hub with us? I can't risk losing
# another guard. The pay's 400 scripts. What do you say?}
{107}{}{你能和我们一起回哈勃城吗？我不能再冒让护卫死的风险了，我给你400块，怎么样？}
#{108}{}{I really could use your help getting back. Rutger's going to kill
# me and I don't know if I can make it alone. If you're interested, pay's
# still 400 scripts. So, what do you say?}
{108}{}{回途真的需要你的帮助。情况这么糟，罗格尔会杀了我的，我也不清楚这点人能不能走回去。如果你有兴趣，我会付你400块，如何？}
#{109}{}{It's going to be a tough trip back going alone. Would you come
# back to the Hub with me for another 400 scripts?}
{109}{}{一个人回去太危险了。你愿意和我一起回去么？我会再付你400块。}
#{110}{}{I can't believe we lost both of the other guards. Rutger and
# Butch are going to have my ass.}
{110}{}{我们居然让其他护卫都送了命，罗格尔和布奇会踢烂我的屁股。}
#{111}{}{Yes.}
{111}{}{好。}
#{112}{}{No.}
{112}{}{不干。}
#{113}{}{Ug.}
{113}{}{呃。}
#{114}{}{Great. Let's go.}
{114}{}{太好了，我们走。}
#{115}{}{What, are you afraid?}
{115}{}{什么，你怕了？}
#{116}{}{Ah, you're missing out on some action.}
{116}{}{啊，你失态了，你啊。}
#{117}{}{That's okay. I'm sure we can make it back without a problem.
# Thanks for helping us all get here in one piece.}
{117}{}{算啦。我们应该能平安回去的。谢谢你一路保护我们。}
#{118}{}{That's okay. I understand. It'll be rough with just one guard,
# but we'll make it.}
{118}{}{吧，我能理解。只有一个保镖确实很危险，但我们会平安回去的。}
#{119}{}{Uh, okay. I'm sure I can make it alone.}
{119}{}{呃，好吧，我们自己也能回去的。}
#{120}{}{You all right? The trip must have been harder on you than I thought.}
{120}{}{你还好吗？这路程是不是对你来说太困难了点？}
#{121}{}{You on drugs?}
{121}{}{你吸毒？}
#{122}{}{Maybe I don't want you on my caravan.}
{122}{}{我想我不需要你这种人。}
#{123}{}{So did you change your mind? Do you want the job?}
{123}{}{改主意了？你想帮我？}
#{124}{}{Yes.}
{124}{}{是的。}
#{125}{}{No.}
{125}{}{不。}
#{126}{}{Ru?}
{126}{}{唔？}
#{127}{}{Easy money. So, do you want to come back with us to the Hub?
# The pay's the same either way; but then again, so is the danger.}
{127}{}{很容易挣的钱。你想和我们一起回哈勃城吗？报酬和过来一样，危险也一样。}
#{128}{}{So, you up for 600 more caps? I've got to head back to the Hub.
# Hopefully this'll be another easy one.}
{128}{}{那么，你还想挣600块吗？我们正想回哈勃，希望回去的路上不会有麻烦。}
#{129}{}{I knew you'd come back with us. It'll be 600 caps again. You
# interested?}
{129}{}{我想你会和我们回去。还是600块，有兴趣吗？}
#{130}{}{I hate losing someone like that; that's why we pay the big bucks.
# This is a dangerous route. Well, Demetre's expecting us back soon. Pay's
# the same. Do you want to come back with us?}
{130}{}{我不想像那样死人。所以我们花大钱雇护卫。这条路线很危险。戴米德希望我们早点回去。报酬还是一样，你想跟来吗？}
#{131}{}{You ready for some more action? This time we won't even get a
# scratch! I'll give you 600 caps for the trip back to the Hub.}
{131}{}{你还想找刺激吗？这次我们会毫发不伤的。如果你愿意跟我们回哈勃城，我会付600块。}
#{132}{}{I know. It's a shame to lose someone, but at least it was in
# battle. You up for another go at it? We're heading back to the Hub.
# Give you 600 caps again.}
{132}{}{我知道，死人总让人遗憾，但毕竟一路上有打仗。你想再保一镖吗？我们回哈勃城，报酬还是600块。}
#{133}{}{Damn, I can't believe we lost both of those guards. Demetre's
# going to be pissed. The pay will be the same, but I'm heading back
# soon. So what do you say? You and me kick some butt?}
{133}{}{可恶，两个保镖都死了。戴米德会发疯的。我们马上就回程，薪酬一样，你愿意干吗？一起杀歹徒玩？}
#{134}{}{Now that was a fight, it's a shame about the other two. Demetre
# won't like these losses but at least we made it. Are you going to be
# accompanying me back the Hub? It will, of course, pay 600 caps.}
{134}{}{好一场恶战，很遗憾两个保镖都死了。戴米德不会喜欢这种损失，但至少我们到目的地了。你想送我们回哈勃吗？报酬600块。}
#{135}{}{I love the taste of battle but I hate loosing my troops. Do you
# think you and I can handle them again? I'm heading out soon -- only
# down side is that the pay's the same. Sorry, no compensation.}
{135}{}{我喜欢战斗的血腥气，但痛恨失去自己的兄弟。你认为我们能再对付这些杂碎一次么？我马上就要回去了――一起回去，报酬不变。不好意思，没有其他补偿了。}
#{136}{}{Mug.}
{136}{}{做鬼脸。}
#{137}{}{Okay. I'm sure we'll make it back just fine.}
{137}{}{好，我相信这次我们能安全回去。}
#{138}{}{I only really need one guard anyhow.}
{138}{}{我无论如何真的需要一名保镖。}
#{139}{}{Ah, I can take them all on myself.}
{139}{}{啊，我能一个人搞定他们。}
#{140}{}{Ah, you're back! You want the job then, right?}
{140}{}{啊，你回来了，你想接下这工作？}
#{141}{}{Arg.}
{141}{}{啊。}
#{142}{}{Why, hello there. Looking for a job? We could use someone to help
# guard our caravans on the way back to the Hub. The pay's 400 scripts.}
{142}{}{你好啊，想要工作吗？我们回哈勃需要保镖。单程400块。}
#{143}{}{Okay.}
{143}{}{好。}
#{144}{}{No thanks.}
{144}{}{不，谢谢。}
#{145}{}{Zuk.}
{145}{}{好啊。}
#{146}{}{Why, hello there. Looking for a job? We could use someone to help
# guard our caravans on the way back to the Hub. The pay's 600 caps, but
# mind you it's normally quite a dangerous trip.}
{146}{}{你好啊，想要工作吗？我们回哈勃城需要保镖。单程600块。要有心里准备，这是很危险的活儿。}
#{147}{}{Sure.}
#{148}{}{Yek.}
#{149}{}{Let me know if you change your mind. We leave at 1400 hours.}
#{150}{}{Sorry, you don't look like you're in any shape for caravan duty.}
#{151}{}{If you can't talk straight I can't hire you.}
#{152}{}{If you want a job, lay off the drugs.}
#{153}{}{Did you change your mind about the job?}
#{154}{}{Yes. I'll hire on.}
#{155}{}{Lum?}
#{156}{}{Here's your pay. Let me know if you're coming back with us.}
{147}{}{好。}
{148}{}{哦。}
{149}{}{改变主意了就和我说，我们下午两点走。}
{150}{}{抱歉，你看起来干不了商队的活儿。}
{151}{}{你要是连话也说不清，我不能雇你。}
{152}{}{你要是想做事，先戒了毒再说。}
{153}{}{你想好了？}
{154}{}{好，我要你了。}
{155}{}{噶？}
{156}{}{这是你的工资，如果想回来和我们一起干，就和我说。}
