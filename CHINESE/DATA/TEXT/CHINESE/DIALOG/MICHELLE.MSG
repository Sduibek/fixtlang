{112}{}{呵呵呵。}
#{113}{}{Nothing. Honest.}
{113}{}{没什么。老兄。}
#{114}{}{I'm just looking around.}
{114}{}{我随便逛逛。}
#{115}{}{This! *smack*}

#{116}{}{A moron. I think that you'd best get out of here. Otherwise,
# you may become target practice.}
{116}{}{白痴。我想你最好快离开这儿。不然，你会变成练习的靶子。}
#{117}{}{Arroo!}
{117}{}{啊哦！}
#{118}{}{Arook.}
{118}{}{啊喔！}
#{119}{}{Nothing, eh? I think you're hiding something. Out with it

# All real aliens are from Venus. Now, you die!}

# explain the benefits of peace.}
{128}{}{如果你的智商够高，我会试试解释和平的好处。}
#{129}{}{If you're here to do that, then you'll need to try and find
# Razor. She'll let you know what we think of that.}
{129}{}{如果你在这做那个，你应该去找找剃刀。她会让你知道我们怎么想那个的。}

# child. Oh, by the way. Here!}
{132}{}{骗我，是不是？我是小孩子？？！！哦，对了，看招！}
#{133}{}{Fancy talk will only get you so far. Here, it will get
# you about six feet under.}
{133}{}{愉快的谈天就到这了。现在，埋了你的时间到了。}
#{134}{}{If you are up to nothing, then we will put you up to
# something. I think 'target' makes a good something.}
{134}{}{如果你什么也不在乎，我们会让你在乎的。我想“靶子”会是个不错的东西。}
#{135}{}{You looked. Now, what do you want? Think quick. It may mean
# the difference between walking out of here and becoming
# a permanent resident.}

#{144}{}{Not so fast. The only way someone leaves here is if they
# are a Blade, or in a bag.}
{144}{}{没这么快。人们离开这里的唯一办法是成为利刃帮的人，或者装在袋子里。}
#{145}{}{Then I want to be a Blade.}
{145}{}{那么我想加入利刃帮。}
#{146}{}{How big is this bag?}

#{147}{}{You forget the third option. Me!}

#{148}{}{Fat chance. But, he's a test. If you can find Razor, then
# you can talk to her about that.}
{148}{}{你没有机会的。不过，聊可一试。如果你找到剃刀，可以和她谈谈测验的事。}
#{149}{}{Big enough to stuff your body parts in when we finish.}
{149}{}{可以大的足够装下你。}
#{150}{}{I am not Sleeping Beauty. I do not need to be awakened.
# Get out or die.}
