# TRANSLATION NOTES
# Vinnie is a gang leader, who is young and ruthless. He tries to sound tough
# and is quite mean. He only respects people who are as ruthless and violent as
# himself.

#{102}{}{I'd like to join you guys.}
{102}{}{伙计们，我想加入你们。}

#{103}{}{You're on Skulz turf, stranger. You'd better talk quick.}
{103}{}{你在骷髅党的地盘上，外地人。你最好有话快说。}

#{104}{}{Sorry, wrong room.}
{104}{}{抱歉，走错房间了。}

#{105}{}{Skulz? Who are you guys?}

#{106}{}{Urgh?}
{106}{}{啊哈？}

#{107}{}{Yeah, you bet this is the wrong room!}
{107}{}{耶，没错！错误的人的房间！}

#{108}{}{We are the one and only Junktown gang. We have the run of the streets,
#and we rule the city at night.}
{108}{}{我们是迦克镇唯一的帮派。我们控制着街道，夜里，迦克镇我们说了算。}

{109}{}{噢。对不起。再见。}

#{110}{}{You couldn't run the schoolyard, Chromo.}

{111}{}{我还以为这个镇子的夜生活是吉斯莫掌管的呢。}

#{112}{}{Get out of here, you moron!}
{112}{}{滚出去，你个白痴！}

#{113}{}{That slob can't even stand up by himself. We're the muscle in this town.
#We take what we want.}
{113}{}{那团烂泥甚至不能自己站起来。我们才是这个城镇的老大，想干啥就干啥。}

#{114}{}{I see.}
{114}{}{我知道了。}

#{115}{}{You have some sort of deal with Killian?}
{115}{}{你和基利安做了某种交易吗？}

#{116}{}{What?! You'll pay for that remark!}
{116}{}{什么？！你要为你说的话付出代价！}

#{117}{}{We don't bother Killian and he doesn't bother us as long as we keep it
#low-key. You get me?}
{117}{}{我们不去烦基利安，他也不来烦我们，只要我们保持低调。你懂我的意思？}

#{118}{}{Yeah. Bye.}
{118}{}{耶。再见。}

#{119}{}{I get it, all right. You have to hide out from him.}
{119}{}{我明白了。你是在躲着他。}

#{120}{}{We don't take that from anybody, least of all Killian! Just because
#he thinks he's a glorified sheriff doesn't mean that he controls the Skulz!}
{120}{}{我们不需要躲着任何人，尤其是基利安！他以为自己是牛皮哄哄镇长，但这不意味着他能控制骷髅党！}

#{121}{}{Sorry, didn't mean to get you all riled up.}
{121}{}{对不起，我不是故意惹恼你的。}

#{122}{}{So, he cramps your style, eh? Mine, too. In fact, I'm thinking of
#whacking him. You want in?}
{122}{}{看来他让你很不爽，哦？我也是。事实上，我正考虑做掉他。你想加入吗？}

#{123}{}{You want to whack Killian? Man, you're crazy. Man, I don't know . . .
#all right, I'm in.}
{123}{}{你想做了基利安？老大，你疯了。嗯，我不知道……好吧，我加入！}

#{124}{}{You loser, you said we were going to whack Killian. Get out of here.}
{124}{}{你个废物，你说过我们要去做掉基利安的。滚出去。}

#{125}{}{C'mon, let's dust Killian.}
{125}{}{来吧，让我们废了基利安。}

#{126}{}{What do you want now?}
{126}{}{你现在想干什么？}

#{127}{}{Nothing. Sorry.}
{127}{}{没什么。抱歉。}

#{128}{}{I'm looking for someone to help me take out Killian. The Skulz seemed like
#a good prospect.}
{128}{}{我正在找些人帮我除掉基利安。骷髅党看起来挺有前途。}

#{129}{}{Damn, I didn't think you'd do it! The Skulz rule this town now! Woo!}
{129}{}{该死，我没想到你会真这么做。骷髅党现在控制整个镇了！哇噢！}

#{130}{}{We've been down this road before. You didn't have the balls then, so get
#the hell out of here!}
{130}{}{我们曾经准备这么做的。结果你没种去干，那就他妈的滚吧！}

#{131}{}{You want to join us, huh? How do we know you're tough enough to be a
#Skul?}
{131}{}{你想加入我们，啊哈？我们怎么知道你够强悍够合格呢？}

#{132}{}{I'll show you tough enough, you son of a bitch!}
{132}{}{我会让你知道我有多狠，你这狗娘养的！}

#{133}{}{Let me prove myself to you.}

#{134}{}{Trust me, I'm tough enough.}
{134}{}{相信我，我够狠。}

#{135}{}{[Vinnie looks at you and laughs.] I don't think so.}
{135}{}{【维尼笑着看你】我不这么认为。}

#{136}{}{I'll prove it to you.}
{136}{}{我会向你证明的。}

#{137}{}{That's it. Time for you to die.}
{137}{}{那么，你死期到了。}

#{138}{}{You're right, I'll be leaving now.}
{138}{}{你是对的，我现在要走了。}

#{139}{}{What makes the Skulz so tough?}
{139}{}{是什么让骷髅党这么强悍？}

#{140}{}{[Vinnie thinks for a second.] If you want to prove you belong in the Skulz,
#I want you to steal that old bastard's wife's ashes. Heh. [Vinnie mumbles]
#Let's make Neal suffer for his last couple of hours . . .}
{140}{}{【维尼想了几秒种】如果你想证明你属于骷髅党，我要你去偷那个老杂种妻子的骨灰罐。呵呵。【维尼嘀咕着】我们让尼尔在临终前痛苦几个小时吧……}

#{141}{}{All right, I'll do it.}
{141}{}{好的，我去做。}

#{142}{}{No way.}
{142}{}{没门。}

#{143}{}{Uh, I don't think I could do that.}
{143}{}{啊，我不认为我会做那个。}

#{144}{}{I already stole it.}
{144}{}{我已经偷来了。}

#{145}{}{That won't be as tough as you might think. I already killed the bastard.}
{145}{}{没你想象的那么麻烦。我已经杀掉那个杂种了。}

#{146}{}{If you're hard enough to do that, mebbe you'd make a Skul after all.
#Bring it here once you've got it.}
{146}{}{要是你能做到，或许你会成为一名骷髅党成员。拿到它以后马上带回来。}

#{147}{}{I knew you weren't Skulz material. Get the hell out of here.}
{147}{}{我就知道你不是进骷髅党的料。他妈的滚出去吧。}

#{148}{}{You got it?}
{148}{}{你拿到了？}

#{149}{}{Yep.}
{149}{}{是啊。}

#{150}{}{No.}
{150}{}{没有。}

#{151}{}{I had to kill Neal to get it. He cried like a little girl.}
{151}{}{我只好杀了尼尔才拿到了这个。他哭喊起来像个小女孩。}

#{152}{}{Ha ha! Let that old cock suffer until we off him tonight - are you in?}
{152}{}{哈哈！先让他好好郁闷一会，晚上我们再让那个老鸡巴上西天，你也去吗？}

#{153}{}{I decided I'd rather not have anything to do with scabs like you.}
{153}{}{我决定不再跟你们这群恶棍鬼混了。}

#{154}{}{Let's crush him.}
{154}{}{我们去搞死他。}

#{155}{}{I've got some other shit to do before then - I'll meet you there.}
{155}{}{在这之前我还有些事要准备－我们在那边碰头。}

#{156}{}{What are you wasting my time for?}
{156}{}{你干吗浪费我的时间？}

#{157}{}{That'll show that old fuck. Thanks for taking care of him for us.
#[Vinnie gets a tear in his eye.] You're a Skul, now.}
{157}{}{老混蛋死有余辜。谢谢你帮我们收拾他。【维尼眼睛有点湿润】现在，你是骷髅党的人了。}

#{158}{}{Uh, all right . . . meet us later, but don't take too long.}
{158}{}{啊，很好……我们到时候见，不要让我们等太久。}

#{159}{}{Soon, Neal gets his, huh?}
{159}{}{很快，尼尔就要完了，啊哈？}

#{160}{}{We said we'd be back, you old fuck!}
{160}{}{我们说过我们会回来的，你个老混蛋！}

#{161}{}{There's a large collection of people arriving at the bar . . .}
{161}{}{有大堆的人正涌到那个酒吧。}

#{162}{}{Fuck you, cop!}
{162}{}{H，条子！}

#{163}{}{You gain 400 experience points for stealing Neal's urn. The dead shall
#never rest in peace.}
{163}{}{你偷到了尼尔的骨灰罐，得到400经验值。死者将永不安息。}

#{164}{}{You gain 300 experience points for puttin' a cap in Neal's ass, you Skul.}

#{165}{}{You ready to take out Neal?}
{165}{}{你准备好收拾尼尔了？}

#{166}{}{Yeah, let's ice the bastard.}
{166}{}{耶，我们去把那个杂种干掉。}

#{167}{}{Nah, I got some more stuff to do.}
{167}{}{啊，我还有点其它的事要做。}

#{168}{}{No way. I want out.}
{168}{}{不行。我要退出。}

#{169}{}{It's too late for that, slick. When you're out, you're way out.}
{169}{}{太迟了，滑头。你要想退出，只有死路一条。}

#{170}{}{We rule this town.}
{170}{}{我们控制这个镇子。}

#{171}{}{Hey, bro, we rule this town!}
{171}{}{嘿，兄弟，我们控制这个镇子！}
