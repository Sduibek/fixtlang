{100}{}{你看见一个末世论者的成员。}
{101}{}{你看见末世论者的兄弟艾伦。}
{102}{}{嘿，你好，老兄。有事吗？}
{103}{}{嘿，我能帮你做什么吗？}
{104}{}{你好。}
{105}{}{嘿，你好，小姐。有事吗？}
{106}{}{哦哇！}
{107}{}{你好。}
{108}{}{我遇到过几个末世论者。你们具体是干什么的？}
{109}{}{我正努力找出一个藏在你们中间的间谍，不过现在还没找到。我能问你们些问题吗？}
{110}{}{哦，嗯, 我主要研究的是哲学和一些其它东西。我的意思是，如果我们要带来和平，那么我们就需要一个好的基础，对吗？}
{111}{}{一个值得的目标。}
{112}{}{你需要的唯一哲学就是一杆枪！}
{113}{}{嗯。好吧。那么，我想我会过会儿再和你谈。}
{114}{}{哇！嘿，我想我帮不了你。}
{115}{}{嘿，就是这种态度才造成所有的这些麻烦和问题。冷静点，好吗？}
{116}{}{嘿，我只是开玩笑而已。}
{117}{}{让我给你一点和平……永恒的安宁。}
{118}{}{嗯，好吧，就这么来吧。}
{119}{}{你还想知道什么？}
{120}{}{你过去有过任何与大教堂教徒的接触吗？}
{121}{}{你曾经离开过图书馆吗？}
{122}{}{你知道有谁经常外出吗？}
{123}{}{不行。我听说他们都是不正常的家伙。我会不想和他们说话。}
{124}{}{不，为什么我要？我喜欢读书。而且无论如何，只有侦察员才到处跑。}
{125}{}{嗯，只有侦察员和守卫。守卫会偶尔去巡逻一下。我想过做一个守卫，但是……呃，我在一场徒手格斗中给狠揍了一顿，所以我没能做成。嗯，侦察兵，他们会走更远，我想有些时候会直接去到大教堂。}
{126}{}{我没有更多问题了，谢谢。}
{127}{}{【更多】}




{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see a member of the 末世论者.}
#{101}{}{You see Brother Alan of the 末世论者.}
#{102}{}{Hey, greetings and good day to you, man. What's up?}
#{103}{}{Hiya. What can I do for you?}
#{104}{}{Hello.}
#{105}{}{Hey, greetings and good day to you, miss. What's up?}
#{106}{}{Owoowngh!}
#{107}{}{Hi.}
#{108}{}{I've met a few of the 末世论者. What exactly do you do?}
#{109}{}{I'm trying to find a spy within your ranks, but I'm not having much luck. Can I ask you some questions?}
#{110}{}{Oh, well, I mostly study philosophy and stuff. I mean, if we're going to bring about peace, then we need a good grounding for it, right?}
#{111}{}{A worthwhile cause.}
#{112}{}{The only philosophy you need is a big gun!}
#{113}{}{Hmm. Okay. Well, I guess I'll talk to you later.}
#{114}{}{Whoa! Hey, I don't think I can help you.}
#{115}{}{Hey, it's exactly that kind of attitude that's causing all this trouble. Just chill out, okay?}
#{116}{}{Heh. I was just kidding.}
#{117}{}{Lemme give you a little peace . . . eternal peace.}
#{118}{}{Uh, sure, go ahead.}
#{119}{}{What else do you want to know?}
#{120}{}{Have you had any contact with the Children of the 大教堂?}
#{121}{}{Do you ever leave the library?}
#{122}{}{Do you know of anyone who regularly goes outside?}
#{123}{}{No way. I hear that they're all freaks. I wouldn't want to talk to them.}
#{124}{}{No, why would I? I just like to read. And anyhow, only scouts really get to go anywhere.}
#{125}{}{Well, just the scouts and the guards. The guards go and patrol a little bit once in a while. I wanted to be a guard but . . . well, I got my ass kicked in
 # hand-to-hand combat, so I couldn't go. Um, the scouts, they go a lot farther,
 # sometimes all the way to the 大教堂, I think.}
#{126}{}{No more questions, thanks.}
