{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see Jerry, a young Initiate.}
#{101}{}{You see a Knight Initiate.}
#{102}{}{You see a Scribe Initiate.}
#{103}{}{Hi there! You must be Brother }
#{104}{}{, the new initiate from the outside. My name's Jerry, I'm your
# new roommate. I'm an initiate too! I've been studying so hard. Are you
# an Initiate Knight or Scribe?}
#{105}{}{I haven't decided.}
#{106}{}{Knight.}
#{107}{}{Scribe.}
#{108}{}{Uk.}
#{109}{}{Yea, being a Knight would be great, they see lots of action and
# get to build all the stuff. I haven't decided yet, but I'm leaning
# towards a Knight myself. Am I boring you? Some people say I talk a lot
# but I just don't think they understand. I just have a lot to say.}
#{110}{}{No, not at all.}
#{111}{}{I've got to go. Nice meeting you.}
#{112}{}{Yea, Scribes have such a creative position. It would be great
# to think up new weapons, modify old ones, and keep records of every
# detail of every item in the Brotherhood. Am I boring you? Some people
# say I talk a lot but I just don't think they understand. I just have
# a lot to say.}
#{113}{}{Yea, I'm still trying to decide. It's so tough, they're both
# really exciting. By the way, if you want the top bunk just let me
# know, I don't mind.}
#{114}{}{Thanks, bye.}
#{115}{}{Are you all right? Maybe you need to see the doctor or maybe
# you just need some sleep. Well I better get back to studying.  Bye.}
#{116}{}{Oh, by the way, I'm glad you'll be my new roommate. My last
# one always wore ear plugs, I don't know why. Anyhow, feel free to
# leave anything you like here, I don't take up much space. Do you want
# the top bunk? I'll change if you want... you don't snore do you? Oh,
# it doesn't matter. See ya.}
#{117}{}{Yea, that's what I thought. Well, I'm glad you'll be my new
# roommate. My last one always wore earplugs, I don't know why. Anyhow,
# feel free to leave anything you like here, I don't take up much space.
# Do you want the top bunk? I'll change if you want... you don't snore
# do you? Oh, it doesn't matter. See ya.}
#{118}{}{Just let me know if I'm snoring.}
#{119}{}{Thomas says I talk to much.}
#{120}{}{Talus says I'd be a good Knight if I didn't talk so much.}
#{121}{}{Nice to see you again, roommate!}
#{122}{}{I didn't sleep well last night.}
#{123}{}{Hi again.}
#{124}{}{I get to go on a patrol tomorrow.}
#{125}{}{I'll be a Senior Initiate in a few years.}
#{126}{}{This isn't your room, please leave.}
#{127}{}{I think you're in Jerry's room.}
#{128}{}{Good luck, you get to room with Jerry the mouth.}
#{129}{}{What are you doin in here?}
#{130}{}{Are you an Initiate too?}
#{131}{}{Visiting?}
#{132}{}{Your room is the first one of the left as you come in.}

{100}{}{你看到杰里，一个新兵。}
{101}{}{你看到一个初级骑士。}
{102}{}{你看到一个初期研究员。}
{103}{}{嘿！你一定是兄弟会的}
{104}{}{，一个刚刚加入的新兵。我叫杰里，你的新室友。我也是新兵呢！我一直很努力的在学习。你是初级的骑士还是研究员？}
{105}{}{我还没想好呢。}
{106}{}{骑士。}
{107}{}{研究员。}
{108}{}{唔。}
{109}{}{对啊，作骑士好象很不错，他们能打仗，还能制造所有设备。我还没决定，不过我自己在向骑士方向发展。我会让你心烦吗？人家说哦，我实在太多话了，但是我想他们还是不了解了，我有自己的说话方式。}
{110}{}{不，一点也不会。}
{111}{}{我得走了，很高兴见到你。}
{112}{}{恩，研究员是很有创造性的职位。很拉风哦，可以发明新武器，改进旧武器，记录兄弟会里所有物品的状况。我会让你心烦吗？人家说哦，我实在太多话了，但是我想他们还是不了解了，我就是有这么多话要说啊。}
{113}{}{唉……我还是犹豫。好难选哦。两个职位都很好啊。哦，对了，如果你想要上铺的话告诉我就好了，我没关系了。}
{114}{}{谢了，回见。}
{115}{}{你还好吧？也许你需要看医生了，或者你该多睡一下。我最好回去学习了。再见。}
{116}{}{哦，还有，我真的很高兴跟你做室友。我上个室友总是戴着耳塞。我也不晓得为什么。不管了，你可以在这里随便放东西。我不会占太大空间的。你想要上铺吗？你要我就跟你换……你打呼噜吗？不打吧？都无所谓了。呆会见。}
{117}{}{对耶，我就是这么想的。哦，还有，我真的很高兴跟你做室友。我上个室友总是戴着耳塞。我也不晓得为什么。不管了，你可以在这里随便放东西。我不会占太大空间的。你想要上铺吗？你要我就跟你换……你打呼噜吗？不打吧？都无所谓了。待会见。}
{118}{}{如果我打呼就跟我说。}
{119}{}{托马斯说我太多话了。}
{120}{}{塔鲁斯队长说如果我没这么多话我会是个好骑士。}
{121}{}{很高兴见到你，室友！}
{122}{}{我昨晚上睡的不太好。}
{123}{}{嗨，又是你。}
{124}{}{我明天要去巡逻。}
{125}{}{在几年内我将成为见习中级骑士。}
{126}{}{这不是你的房间，请离开。}
{127}{}{我想你在杰里的房间里。}
{128}{}{祝你好运，你得跟大嘴杰里住一起。}
{129}{}{你在这干嘛呢？}
{130}{}{你也是新兵？}
{131}{}{在参观？}
{132}{}{你的房间是进来时左手边第一间。}
