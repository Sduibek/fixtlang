{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see a farmer.}
#{101}{}{Hi there, stranger. Like my crops?}
#{102}{}{Good morning to you!}
#{103}{}{Good afternoon!}
#{104}{}{Evening, friend!}
#{105}{}{Nice day, isn't it?}
#{106}{}{This soil is much healthier than it looks.}
#{107}{}{I'm trying to save these trees and I think it's working.}
#{108}{}{There should be a fertilizer caravan.  Now there's some money.}
#{109}{}{Come on in, there's plenty of room.}
#{110}{}{It's a little chilly out there; have a seat.}
#{111}{}{Farming suits me.}
#{112}{}{Did you know plants grow better when you're nice to them?}
#{113}{}{I wish I had a little more land.}
#{114}{}{Did you know there used to be large bodies of drinkable water?}
#{115}{}{I've read about rivers. I sure wish I had one next to my fields.}
#{116}{}{I wish the days were longer; there's so much to do.}
{100}{}{你看见一个农夫。}
{101}{}{嗨，你好！陌生人。喜欢我的庄稼吗？}
{102}{}{早上好啊！}
{103}{}{下午好啊！}
{104}{}{朋友，晚上好！}
{105}{}{天气不错啊！}
{106}{}{这土壤要比看起来肥沃好多。}
{107}{}{我尽力保护这些树，我想还有效果。}
{108}{}{那应该有卖肥料的商队。还有一些钱。}
{109}{}{进来吧！那儿有宽裕的房间。}
{110}{}{外面有点冷的：请坐。}
{111}{}{我就适合种地。}
{112}{}{你知道你对它们越好它们长得也越好吗？}
{113}{}{我希望能多那么一点地。}
{114}{}{你知道哪里曾经有大量的饮用水吗？}
{115}{}{我在书上看到过大河。我真想在我的地旁边就有这么一条。}
{116}{}{我希望一天过的再长些：那我就可以做更多的事情了。}
