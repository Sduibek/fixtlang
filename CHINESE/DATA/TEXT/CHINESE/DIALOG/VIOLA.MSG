{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see a woman.}
#{101}{}{I do not wish to die, sir. I am not a soldier.}
#{102}{}{I do not wish to die, ma'am. I am not a soldier.}
#{103}{}{Start talking, and I'll let you live.}
#{104}{}{Neither am I. I only kill when I have to.}
#{105}{}{Aren't you going to praise the Master or something!}
#{106}{}{I'll trade your life for a good stiff drink. Where do they keep the booze?}
#{107}{}{Good night bitch!}
#{108}{}{Me Big Soldier! Hah! Hah! Hah!}
#{109}{}{I'm glad you came to talk to me. I heard what you said to Laura. You mustn't do this.}
#{110}{}{What do you think I'm going to do?}
#{111}{}{Laura? Who's Laura?}
#{112}{}{Oh, oh.}
#{113}{}{Oh, that was a big mistake! And it's gonna cost you.}
#{114}{}{Wha tak? Raar!}
#{115}{}{I think we've said all that needs to be said. Good bye.}
#{116}{}{I do not speak to people at the point of a weapon. Lower it, and we may talk.}
#{117}{}{Hello again. I hope you've found this place interesting.}
#{118}{}{I've seen higher forms of entertainment.}
#{119}{}{Of course, sister. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame!}
#{120}{}{You know, every time I talk to someone, people keep repeating everything they say over and over again.}
#{121}{}{Entertainment? Where's the booze!}
#{122}{}{This place is boring! Where's the blood? Where's the death?}
#{123}{}{Greetings initiate. How may I be of service to you?}
#{124}{}{I was a little nervous about our long range plans.}
#{125}{}{What's going on around here?}
#{126}{}{Where's the Master?}
#{127}{}{Who's in charge here?}
#{128}{}{Gimme a break sister. Nobody serves another person unless a gun's against their head!}
#{129}{}{Hello, sir. Your reputation precedes you! Is there anything I can help you with?}
#{130}{}{Hello, miss. Your reputation precedes you! Is there anything I can help you with?}
#{131}{}{I was wondering what the Cathedral is all about.}
#{132}{}{How does one become an initiate?}
#{133}{}{Where's the Master?}
#{134}{}{Who's in charge here?}
#{135}{}{Gimme a break sister. Nobody serves another person unless a gun's against their head!}
#{136}{}{Hello, sir. Your reputation precedes you! Is there anything I can help you with?}
#{137}{}{Hello, miss. Your reputation precedes you! Is there anything I can help you with?}
#{138}{}{I was wondering what the Cathedral is all about.}
#{139}{}{How does one become an initiate?}
#{140}{}{Where's the Master?}
#{141}{}{Who's in charge here?}
#{142}{}{Gimme a break sister. Nobody serves another person unless a gun's against their head!}
#{143}{}{I know who you are. And you will forgive my rudeness, but I don't speak to psychotic killers. Good-bye.}
#{144}{}{My reputation has been greatly exaggerated. Does the Cathedral judge people on rumor and innuendo?}
#{145}{}{Psychotic killer? Who, me!}
#{146}{}{Baby, I'm no psycho, I'm just plain nuts, and if you don't answer my questions I'll prove it!}
#{147}{}{I do not form bonds of loyalty easily. And I do not break them easily either. I will tell you nothing.}
#{148}{}{Good. Then we can leave each other alone and call it even.}
#{149}{}{Praising the Master will not save my life. Go ahead, and do it. I can do nothing to stop you.}
#{150}{}{There's a still somewhere away from the Cathedral. They don't permit drugs or alcohol around here.}
#{151}{}{Attempt to take the key to the secret entrance from Morpheus and kill the Master.}
#{152}{}{Why wouldn't I want to do that?}
#{153}{}{I don't know what you're talking about.}
#{154}{}{Why would I want to do that?}
#{155}{}{Have you ever heard about knowing too much?}
#{156}{}{The spy for the Followers of the Apocalypse who's currently in one of the meditation rooms.}
#{157}{}{There's a spy here? We must inform the High Priests at once!}
#{158}{}{I don't know what you're talking about.}
#{159}{}{Why would I be spying on you?}
#{160}{}{Have you ever heard about knowing too much?}
#{161}{}{This place isn't about entertainment, it's about enlightenment. More importantly, it's about making the right choices about the destiny of the world. See you around.}
#{162}{}{Riight. Sure. Of course. See you later.}
#{163}{}{I know. I have a tendency to do that too, when I have nothing original to say. See you later.}
#{164}{}{People who have the spirit of the Holy Flame need no other spirits. Or so they say. You know how that goes_}
#{165}{}{Upstairs. Ask the Nightkin to shed your blood, they'll be more than happy to oblige.}
#{166}{}{Because the Master is a necessary evil. Because somebody has to unite the world, and he's the only one in the area who has a chance to unify it.}
#{167}{}{Anyone ever tell you that Unity is overrated?}
#{168}{}{Why?}
#{169}{}{I don't believe in necessary evils.}
#{170}{}{I like this world just fine.}
#{171}{}{I don't think I like this conversation.}
#{172}{}{Very well, if you won't acknowledge what you said, I won't help you. Good bye.}
#{173}{}{Because you think that it's wrong for the Children to invade our neighbors. Because you think that killing the Master will stop it.}
#{174}{}{And if I believed that, why would I be wrong?}
#{175}{}{That's blasphemy!}
#{176}{}{If you think that I believe it, why haven't you turned me over?}
#{177}{}{Do I look like the sort of person who minds a good killing?}
#{178}{}{Have you ever heard of being in over your head? No one, however well-armed or trained, can defeat a half dozen Nightkin. I'm a woman of peace. I'm trying to save you.}
#{179}{}{Look at the people who caused the Apocalypse! They didn't believe in peace and unity, and look what they did to us! Unity is the only way to prevent this from happening again, and Unity must happen NOW, before the other Vaults around the world have a chance to muster their forces.}
#{180}{}{You seem a little too intelligent for this pack of zombies.}
#{181}{}{You want everyone to act like the people in this room? That's worse than being dead!}
#{182}{}{You're crazy! That'll just lead to another Apocalypse.}
#{183}{}{And why is the Master the best one to lead us?}
#{184}{}{You've never taken a life? You aren't packing enough firepower to give the Brotherhood of Steel gun envy? Stop being such a hypocrite! You feel it's justified to defend yourself. The Master's defending humanity from another attack of self-destruction. It's all the same!}
#{185}{}{How do you know there isn't someone better out there?}
#{186}{}{Maybe I should consider this.}
#{187}{}{So mass slaughter is all right if you intend to save the world?}
#{188}{}{That's bullshit, Lady!}
#{189}{}{What the Hell kind of world do you think this is? It's a nightmare out there!}
#{190}{}{How do you know there isn't something better out there?}
#{191}{}{Maybe I should consider this.}
#{192}{}{A world where I can be free to live my own life as I choose.}
#{193}{}{Life ain't pretty, sister. Never has been, never will be.}
#{194}{}{Tough. I don't like radiation and the FEV virus, but I didn't have a choice about it. You can't always get what you want in this world. Sometimes you have to make compromises. And sometimes you have to open your mind to unpleasant ideas.}
#{195}{}{Funny. I don't see the Master allowing his flock to do that.}
#{196}{}{There's compromises, and there's genocide.}
#{197}{}{Get out of my face!}
#{198}{}{The only choice that concerns me right now is how long you're going to live.}
#{199}{}{Maybe I'll be so intelligent that when the Master takes power, I'll be able to do something to help. Maybe you will too! Join us! Join us and change the world! Just think about it, that's all I ask!}
#{200}{}{There have always been drones in any society. Forget them! We need drones, but we also need soldiers and queens. And you look like a good soldier at least. Consider what you could do, you could be very useful to our cause. Help us. Think about what I've said, that's all I ask!}
#{201}{}{Or maybe we can overwhelm their defenses before they have time to build up again. Maybe we can unite the other Vaults and cities with one swift, clean stroke. A united world won't be perfect, but it will have a better chance of holding itself together. Think about it!}
#{202}{}{I've looked at the locals. The Brotherhood of Steel and the Children of the Apocalypse just want to be left alone. The Hub thinks they can buy the world - what a pack of fools! Only the Master has the strength to do what must be done. Think about it!}
#{203}{}{I'm glad to hear that. I hope you come to the right decision.}
#{204}{}{No. It isn't all right. But it's the only option that has a chance of saving us over the long term, which is why I'm with these people. There's no better way! Think about it!}
#{205}{}{Is it? Think about it. Think real hard. If you continue to oppose us, you'll die. You've seen our forces, you know there's more where that came from. A lot more! You can't stop us! But If you join us, you could save lives. Just think about it!}
#{206}{}{I don't. But if I see someone else I like, I'll be in position to help them. None of the locals have a chance. They're all dead, or converted if they're fortunate. You can be one of the fortunate ones. Join us. Just think about it!}
#{207}{}{The world won't stay like that. It never does. And if all we do is build packs of powerful enclaves, eventually one of them will get powerful enough to start the Apocalypse over again. Join us and unite the world before this happens! Think about it!}
#{208}{}{And that's just a cowardly excuse that solves nothing. If life is shitty, we should try to change it. We owe it to ourselves and to our children. Do you think the world will stay the same when we divide ourselves into warring pieces? Think about it!}
#{209}{}{Or maybe there's salvation disguised as genocide. Maybe the world won't be such a bad place if people work for the Master's vision. Perhaps we can even find ways to do it with less bloodshed. Think about it!}
#{210}{}{Fine. But if you continue on your current path, you will die. I thought I should warn you.}
#{211}{}{You can kill me. You'll prove my point, of course, but I'll still die. Your choice.}
#{212}{}{Because of the Apocalypse! Look what it did to us! Unity is the only way to prevent this from happening again, and Unity must happen NOW, before the other Vaults around the world have a chance to muster their forces.}
#{213}{}{You seem a little too intelligent for this pack of zombies.}
#{214}{}{You want everyone to act like the people in this room? That's worse than being dead!}
#{215}{}{I'll consider it.}
#{216}{}{You're crazy! That'll just lead to another Apocalypse.}
#{217}{}{And why is the Master the best one to lead us?}
#{218}{}{I ain't a philosopher lady. I'm just someone who's good at killing.}
#{219}{}{Because you're an intelligent and brave person who could be of great help to us. Yes, some of things we do are horrible. But our overall goal is not only good, it's necessary to the survival of the human race. Don't be so hasty to help the Followers. They don't have all the answers!}
#{220}{}{You seem a little too intelligent for this pack of zombies.}
#{221}{}{You want everyone to act like the people in this room? That's worse than being dead!}
#{222}{}{I'll consider it.}
#{223}{}{You're crazy! That'll just lead to another Apocalypse.}
#{224}{}{And why is the Master the best one to lead us?}
#{225}{}{I ain't a philosopher lady. I'm just someone who's good at killing.}
#{226}{}{We all have a part to play. Some of us are mindless drones who do the work meant for stupid people. Some of us are thinkers. Some of us are killers. There's a place for you here if you want it. Please think about it!}
#{227}{}{We have many things planned. The Holy Flame came first, which purged the world of evil. Then came the Master. Now we are at the time of Unity, when we struggle to conquer the divisions of the world. After Unity shall come Peace. The Age of Peace is the reason for all our struggles.}
#{228}{}{Why must so many people die to attain peace?}
#{229}{}{That sounds wonderful. Praise the Master!}
#{230}{}{But wasn't the fire of the Apocalypse evil?}
#{231}{}{This all sounds like bullshit to me.}
#{232}{}{I'm sure you are. Nervousness is a wise emotion, it keeps us from prying into unpleasant corners, and prevents us from doing stupid things. Good-bye.}
#{233}{}{Initiates seek the answers to questions. Which is what you should be doing. Good-bye.}
#{234}{}{I don't know. People believe his spirit is within these walls. It certainly sounds like that to me.}
#{235}{}{What do people say about his physical form?}
#{236}{}{Did I hear a bit of skepticism?}
#{237}{}{Is there even a Master, or is this a scam?}
#{238}{}{That's an annoyingly vague answer.}
#{239}{}{Thank you, sister.}
#{240}{}{The high priest of the Cathedral is Morpheus. He can be found in the Upper Sanctuary, but does not give personal audiences. You might persuade Father Lasher to vouch for you, he can be found down here, in the Rectory.}
#{241}{}{Morpheus? Is he a good man?}
#{242}{}{Why do they call him Lasher?}
#{243}{}{And what about the Master?}
#{244}{}{Is there anything else I should know?}
#{245}{}{Thank you, sister.}
#{246}{}{You may change your mind. Or you may lose your life. This all depends on your actions and your point of view. Good-bye.}
#{247}{}{We have very similar interests. You have slain monsters and brigands and made the world a safer place. We plan to do the same, on a larger scale.}
#{248}{}{What sort of scale?}
#{249}{}{Who are the monsters and brigands that you're planning to slay?}
#{250}{}{Does this have anything to do with the Holy Flame I keep hearing about?}
#{251}{}{Sorry lady, but I don't believe a word of what you're saying.}
#{252}{}{How wonderful. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame!}
#{253}{}{Peace, love, and Unity, of course. What else could we be about? But you can discover these things for yourself. Good-bye.}
#{254}{}{You should spend several weeks of meditation and fasting here, and then approach one of the elders. Or you could volunteer for service work.}
#{255}{}{I've noticed some of your people in other towns...}
#{256}{}{Who do I approach about volunteering?}
#{257}{}{Weeks! That's a long wait.}
#{258}{}{What elder is the best to approach?}
#{259}{}{Service work? Like killing your enemies?}
#{260}{}{My apologies. At the very least, you might be honestly seeking redemption for your crimes. How may I help you.}
#{261}{}{I was wondering what the Cathedral is all about.}
#{262}{}{How does one become an initiate?}
#{263}{}{Where's the Master?}
#{264}{}{Who's in charge here?}
#{265}{}{Gimme a break sister! Nobody serves another person unless a gun's against their head!}
#{266}{}{It is dangerous to allow a mad dog into one's house, just because you can't see its saliva. Good-bye.}
#{267}{}{Then you have been maligned, because the entire Boneyard tells horror stories about you. And I have no desire to find out if they're true. Good-bye.}
#{268}{}{No struggle comes without a price, and the greatest struggle inevitably enacts the greatest cost. That is the paradox of peace, I fear. Words to think about, at any rate. Good-bye.}
#{269}{}{That is a paradox. Of course it was, but the greatest evils can lead to the greatest good. All it requires is intelligence and courage on the part of those who survive. Words to think about, at any rate. Good-bye.}
#{270}{}{We shouldn't judge people by physical appearance. The Master's goal is noble, and that's all I need to know. As for what other people say, ask them.}
#{271}{}{Perhaps a bit. The Master's vision is so ambitious and brilliant that I suppose I can be forgiven a few doubts. If I discouraged you, I apologize. I would suggest you seek hardier souls than mine for instruction. Good-bye.}
#{272}{}{Of course there's a Master! Why wouldn't there be? We do many things, even some things I'm not entirely proud of, but deceit isn't one of them. The Master's vision of Peace and Unity is a true one. Good-bye.}
#{273}{}{There's nothing vague about 'I don't know'. Goodbye sir.}
#{274}{}{There's nothing vague about 'I don't know'. Goodbye miss].}
#{275}{}{You're welcome sir. May the Master bless you with wisdom.}
#{276}{}{You're welcome miss. May the Master bless you with wisdom.}
#{277}{}{He's an intelligent man, and is trusted by the Master. That should be enough. May the Master bless you with wisdom. Good-bye.}
#{278}{}{He educates the children, and does so harshly. Is there anything else?}
#{279}{}{Morpheus? Is he a good man?}
#{280}{}{Why should Lasher be allowed to hurt children?}
#{281}{}{And what about the Master?}
#{282}{}{Is there anything else I should know?}
#{283}{}{Thank you, sister.}
#{284}{}{I can tell you nothing that you don't already know. My apologies.}
#{285}{}{Many things I'm sure. But these answers are best discovered on our own, not through rumor and innuendo. Good-bye.}
#{286}{}{You are welcome, sir.}
#{287}{}{You are welcome, miss.}
#{288}{}{As large as possible. The world is in chaos. It needs order, or it will not survive. We will bring order, and prevent the monsters from hurting it again, as they did in the Apocalypse. Words to think about, at any rate. Good-bye.}
#{289}{}{Those who would let their selfish desires oppose the better good of humanity. The Apocalypse was caused by human selfishness. If the world is to survive, this madness must be purged from the human heart. Words to think about, at any rate. Good-bye.}
#{290}{}{}
#{291}{}{}
#{292}{}{}
#{293}{}{}
#{294}{}{There was Deacon Olivier; no, she's gone now_ and Father Pinochet_ no, he's no longer available. I hesitate to mention Lasher, but he's the only one left now. Well, I'm sure you'll find a way. Good luck.}
#{295}{}{Death is never a service, even when it's a necessity. Good bye sir.}
#{296}{}{Death is never a service, even when it's a necessity. Good bye miss.}
#{297}{}{That is something I've wondered myself. But such criticism is not warranted, I'm certain. Perhaps you should speak to the children.}
#{298}{}{[done]}
#{299}{}{Me go.}

{100}{}{你看到一个女人。}
{101}{}{我不希望死，先生。我不是一个士兵。}
{102}{}{我不希望死，小姐。我不是一个士兵。}
{103}{}{听我问话，我就不杀你。}
{104}{}{我也不是士兵，只有在迫不得已的时候才杀人。}
{105}{}{你怎么没去赞美主教！或者做做祷告什么的？}
{106}{}{你可以拿些喝的来换你的命，他们把酒都放哪了？}
{107}{}{晚安！婊子！}
{108}{}{我是个大兵！哇哈哈哈哈！哇哈哈哈哈！}
{109}{}{很高兴你能和我谈话，我听说你和劳拉的事情了，你没必要这样做。}
{110}{}{你认为我会如何去做？}
{111}{}{劳拉？谁是劳拉？}
{112}{}{噢，哦。}
{113}{}{啊，你听了不该听的东西，你会死的。}
{114}{}{说，什，啥？啊！}
{115}{}{我认为我们该说的都说了，再见。}
{116}{}{我不会和一个用武器指着我的人说话，除非你把它收起来。}
{117}{}{又见面了。但愿你会喜欢这个地方。}
{118}{}{我们有更高层次的娱乐方式。}
{119}{}{当然，姊妹。赞美主教！赞美圣火！}
{120}{}{你要知道，每次我和别人说话，一句话总要反复说上几遍。}
{121}{}{娱乐？拿酒来！}
{122}{}{这地方好无聊啊！血在哪里啊？死亡在哪里啊？}
{123}{}{你好，新人。需要我帮助吗？}
{124}{}{关于我们的远大计划，我有点担心。}
{125}{}{附近发生了什么？}
{126}{}{主教在什么地方？}
{127}{}{谁是这的主管？}
{128}{}{给我打住吧修女。没人甘愿当别人的奴隶，除非有一支枪对着他们的头！}
{129}{}{你好，先生。久仰大名！我能帮你做些什么吗？}
{130}{}{你好，小姐。久仰大名！我能帮你做些什么吗？}
{131}{}{我对所有关于大教堂的事都很感兴趣。}
{132}{}{如何才能入教？}
{133}{}{主教在什么地方？}
{134}{}{谁是这的主管？}
{135}{}{给我打住吧修女。没人甘愿当别人的奴隶，除非有一支枪对着他们的头！}
{136}{}{你好，先生。久仰大名！我能帮你做些什么吗？}
{137}{}{你好，小姐。久仰大名！我能帮你做些什么吗？}
{138}{}{我想知道大教堂究竟是做什么的。}
{139}{}{如何才能入教？}
{140}{}{主教在什么地方？}
{141}{}{谁是这的主管？}
{142}{}{给我打住吧修女。没人甘愿当别人的奴隶，除非有一支枪对着他们的头！}
{143}{}{我知道你是谁。请原谅我的无礼，我不想跟变态杀人狂说话。再见。}
{144}{}{我的名声被过分渲染了，大教堂难道只会以谣言来判断一个人吗？}
{145}{}{变态杀人狂？谁？我？}
{146}{}{宝贝儿，我可不变态。我只是有患有狂躁症，如果你不回答我的问题我就犯病给你看!}
{147}{}{我不是轻易效忠别人的人，也不是轻易背叛誓言的人，我什么都不告诉你。}
{148}{}{好把，那我们就各走各路，互不相欠。}
{149}{}{赞美主教无法挽救我的生命。动手吧，我阻止不了你。}
{150}{}{酒厂在离大教堂很远的地方，这里不允许毒品和酒精。}
{151}{}{从墨菲斯拿到秘密入口的钥匙，然后去杀主教。}
{152}{}{为什么我不能那么干？}
{153}{}{我不知道你在说什么。}
{154}{}{为什么我要那么干？}
{155}{}{有句话叫做，知道的越多越不好。}
{156}{}{是末世论者的一个间谍，在一间冥想室里。}
{157}{}{这有一个间谍？我们必须立刻通知高等牧师。}
{158}{}{我不知道你在说什么。}
{159}{}{我为什么要监视你？}
{160}{}{有句话叫做，知道的越多越不好。}
{161}{}{这里不是娱乐场所，这里的作用是启迪和开导。最重要的作用是正确选择世界的命运。再见。}
{162}{}{好的！当然！没错！回见！}
{163}{}{我明白，我也有那么做的倾向，当我没什么可说的时候，回见！}
{164}{}{人只要有了圣火的精神就别无它求，正如他们所说，你应该知道如何去做。}
{165}{}{楼上的夜行团会很乐意给你放放血的。}
{166}{}{主教的作为是一种天灾，世界必须“同一”，而他是这里唯一有机会“同一”世界的人。}
{167}{}{没人告诉过你“同一”是被夸大了的谎言吗？}
{168}{}{为什么？}
{169}{}{我不相信什么天灾。}
{170}{}{我喜欢这美好的世界。}
{171}{}{和你说话很无趣。}
{172}{}{很好，如果你不承认你说的，我是不会帮你的。再见。}
{173}{}{因为你认为大教堂侵略我们的邻居是错的。因为你认为杀死主教就能制止这一切的发生。}
{174}{}{如果我相信，为什么我还会错？}
{175}{}{那是亵渎神明！}
{176}{}{如果你认为我这么想，为什么你不来揭发我？}
{177}{}{我看上去像杀人狂这类人吗？}
{178}{}{你听说过那种东西吗？没人能击败那么多夜行团，就算你有再好的装备也是一样不行。我是个热爱和平的女人，我在试图拯救你。}
{179}{}{你看那些造成大毁灭的人！他们不相信和平与统一！看看他们对我们所做的吧！只有统一才能阻止这一切再次发生，在全世界的避难所有能力召集军队之前，我们必须开展统一。}
{180}{}{你这个邪教徒似乎有点儿聪明了过头了。}
{181}{}{你想要每个人都像这个房间中的那些人一样？那可是比死亡还可怕的事情！}
{182}{}{你疯了！那样只会导致出现另外一个“大毁灭”的。}
{183}{}{为什么主教是我们最好的领导人？}
{184}{}{你从没杀过人？你们没有能让钢铁兄弟会嫉妒的火力？停止你的伪善吧！你认为替自己辩护是合理的，主教所谓拯救世界免于自毁也是一种辩解啊。都是一个道理！}
{185}{}{你怎么知道没有人比他更好?}
{186}{}{也许我应该再考虑考虑。}
{187}{}{你说想拯救世界，就可以这么滥杀无辜吗？}
{188}{}{你在放屁！}
{189}{}{你以为现在的世界是什么样的？就像恶梦那！}
{190}{}{你怎么知道事情不会变得更好？}
{191}{}{也许我应该再考虑考虑。}
{192}{}{能自由自在，选择自己生活的世界。}
{193}{}{生活并不美好，我的姐妹，生活从来、也将一直都是艰苦的。}
{194}{}{很难，我不喜欢放射线和FEV病毒，但是我毕竟生活在这个时代，我没得选择。有时你必须妥协。有时你就算再不高兴也必须接受。}
{195}{}{好笑。我可没看到主教允许他的手下那么做。}
{196}{}{是妥协, 还是蓄意的屠杀。}
{197}{}{走开，我不想再见到你。}
{198}{}{只有一种选择和我有关系，那就是你还能活多长。}
{199}{}{也许我足够聪明，当主教成功后，我能帮他做些什么。加入我们的行列！让我们一起改变世界！我只希望你能好好想想！这就是我所有的请求。}
{200}{}{任何地方总会有那么些平庸的人，我们需要这些人，但是我们更需要精英，至少我认为你应该是一个非常不错的战士，考虑一下，你对我们的事业可能是非常有用的。加入我们。我希望你好好想一下我所说的！}
{201}{}{也许我们能在防卫建立之前击溃他们。也许我们能迅速地统一所有的避难所，还有城市。统一的世界虽不算完美，但至少不太会四分五裂的。恩，仔细考虑下吧！}
{202}{}{我分析过各地的情况，钢铁兄弟会和启示录想各自为政，他们都必须被消灭掉，而哈勃城那些人认为他们能买下整个世界－多么愚蠢的一群人！只有主教才有实现理想的力量。仔细考虑下吧！}
{203}{}{听到这话我很高兴，我希望你能做出正确的决定。}
{204}{}{当然不是完美的。但那是唯一能拯救我们的机会，这就是我为什么和这些人在一起的原因。没有更好的办法！考虑下吧！}
{205}{}{你可要给我想清楚了。如果你继续反对我们，你就会死。你见过我们的军队，你知道还有更多的军队会陆续到达。很多很多！你阻止不了我们！但是如果你加入我们，你可以拯救生命。想想看吧！}
{206}{}{没有。如果我见到我喜欢的人，我会以我的立场去帮助他们。不过本地人里没有这样的英雄，这些人都要死，或者，其中幸运地被转化。你就属于那类幸运的人。考虑下吧！}
{207}{}{世界绝对不会继续像现在这样平静的，从来不会。如果人们各自结帮，最终必然会再次爆发世界大毁灭。加入我们，在灾难再次降临前统一世界吧！考虑下吧！}
{208}{}{那只不过是懦弱藉口。不能解决根本问题，如果生活环境很差，我们就应该试着改变它。否则我们对不起自己，也对不起我们的后代。如果人们还是各自为政，你认为这个世界会停止战争吗？想想看吧！}
{209}{}{也许像这种有计划的屠杀可以拯救人类。如果人人都为主教的梦想工作，也许这世界将会变得更好。也许我们能找到少流血的方法。想想看吧!}
{210}{}{很好。如果你继续沿着你现在的路走下去，你就会死。我想我应该事先警告你一下。}
{211}{}{你可以杀我。即使我死了，我的观点最终也会被证实。你选择吧。}
{212}{}{因为大毁灭！看看它对我们所做的吧！只有统一才能阻止这一切再次发生，在全世界的避难所有能力召集军队之前，我们必须开展“同一”。}
{213}{}{你这个邪教徒似乎有点儿聪明了过头了。}
{214}{}{你想要每个人都像这个房间中的那些人一样？那可是比死亡还可怕的事情！}
{215}{}{我会考虑的。}
{216}{}{你疯了！那样只会导致出现另外一个“大毁灭”的。}
{217}{}{为什么主教是我们最好的领导人？}
{218}{}{我不是一个哲学家，女士。我只是一个杀人狂。}
{219}{}{因为你是聪明勇敢的人，是对我们很有帮助的人。是的，我们做的有些事是很可怕。但是我们的出发点是好的，对于人类的生存是必需的。不要去帮助末世论者。他们不会给你答案的！}
{220}{}{你这个邪教徒似乎有点儿聪明了过头了。}
{221}{}{你想要每个人都像这个房间中的那些人一样？那可是比死亡还可怕的事情！}
{222}{}{我会考虑的。}
{223}{}{你疯了！那样只会导致出现另外一个“大毁灭”的。}
{224}{}{为什么主教是我们最好的领导人？}
{225}{}{我不是一个哲学家，女士。我只是一个杀人狂。}
{226}{}{我们全都是游戏的一部分。我们的一些人像雄蜂一样做着愚昧无知的工作。我们的一些人是思想家。我们的一些人是杀手。只要你想要，这里就有你的位置。好好想想吧！}
{227}{}{我们有很多计划。首先用圣火净化这个肮脏的世界。然后主教带领我们努力征服世界，“同一”世界。在“同一”之后我们将迎来和平。和平的时代是我们所有人的梦想。}
{228}{}{为什么非要死那么多人才能换来和平？}
{229}{}{听起来令人愉快。赞美主教！}
{230}{}{大毁灭的火难道不是邪恶的吗？}
{231}{}{对我来说都是放屁。}
{232}{}{你就是。敏感是个好东西，可以让人不听墙角，并阻止我们做蠢事。再见。}
{233}{}{学员要自己去寻找问题的答案。那才是你应该做的。再见。}
{234}{}{我不知道。人们相信他的精神在这些墙壁里面。我也觉得确实是那样。}
{235}{}{关于他的身体特征，人们都说了什么？}
{236}{}{有人怀疑么？}
{237}{}{那个什么主教？也许是一个骗局？}
{238}{}{那是一个恼人含糊的答案。}
{239}{}{谢谢你，姊妹。}
{240}{}{大教堂的高等牧师是梦神墨菲斯。你能在上面的庇护所中找到他，但是他一般不接见人。你也许可以说服拉舍尔神父为你引见，你能在这个教区中找到他。}
{241}{}{墨菲斯？他是一个好人吗？}
{242}{}{他们为什么叫他拉舍尔？}
{243}{}{主教呢？}
{244}{}{我还应该知道别的什么吗？}
{245}{}{谢谢你，姊妹。}
{246}{}{你也许会改变你的想法。你也可能丧命。这全取决于你的行动和你的观点。再见。}
{247}{}{我们其实是趣味相投的。你通过杀怪物和土匪使世界变得更安全。在某种意义上我们做的事是一样的。}
{248}{}{从什么意义上说？}
{249}{}{你正在计划杀哪些怪物和土匪？}
{250}{}{这和我听说的那个圣火有什么关系？}
{251}{}{抱歉小姐，我不相信你说的每个字。}
{252}{}{多神奇啊！赞美主教！赞美圣火！}
{253}{}{和平，爱还有“同一”，当然。我们还需要别的吗？你要为自己的将来去追寻这些。再见。}
{254}{}{你应该在这里祷告和斋戒几个星期，见见高级教士，或者做做义务服务。}
{255}{}{我在其他的地方留意过你们的人……}
{256}{}{我怎么做义务服务？}
{257}{}{几个星期！那也太久了。}
{258}{}{哪个长辈最好接触？}
{259}{}{服务工作？比如帮你们杀敌？}
{260}{}{我深表歉意，你最后会为自己的罪行真诚乞求救赎的。你现在还想要什么？}
{261}{}{大教堂究竟做什么？}
{262}{}{怎么才能入会？}
{263}{}{谁是主教？}
{264}{}{谁是这里的头？}
{265}{}{给我打住吧修女。没人甘愿当别人的奴隶，除非有一支枪对着他们的头！}
{266}{}{最危险的事情就是因为你没有看到他嘴流着口水，你允许一只疯狗进入到自己的房间。再见。}
{267}{}{整个的晒骨场都有关于你的恐怖传闻，不过我没有兴趣研究他们说得是真是假。再见。}
{268}{}{没有代价就没有斗争，而伟大的事业不可避免的要付出最高的代价。这就是和平的矛盾，仔细考虑吧。再见。}
{269}{}{虽然它是个矛盾。但是最大的邪恶也能导致最好的善行。只需要活着的人付出智慧和勇气。想想吧，再见。}
{270}{}{我们不应该以表面现象去判断一个人。我只知道主教的目标是高尚的。至于其他人怎么说，你去问他们。}
{271}{}{也许。主教的理想是如此野心勃勃和光辉灿烂，我认为主教会宽恕我对他的一点点怀疑。如果我让你气馁了，我道歉。建议你去找心智比我更坚强的人讨论这个问题。再见。}
{272}{}{主教当然是存在的！为什么你认为不存在！？我们做过许多事，即使有一些事我们无法为之自傲，但是我们从未欺骗过谁。主教的和平与“同一”的梦想是真的。再见。}
{273}{}{明确的告诉你“我不知道”。再见先生。}
{274}{}{明确的告诉你“我不知道”。再见小姐。}
{275}{}{欢迎你，先生。愿主教祝福你。}
{276}{}{欢迎你，小姐。愿主教祝福你。}
{277}{}{他是个聪明的人，很受主教信赖。能告诉你的就这么多了。愿主教祝福你。再见。}
{278}{}{他教育孩子是非常的严厉。还有别的吗?}
{279}{}{墨菲斯？他是个好人吗？}
{280}{}{为什么拉舍尔可以伤害孩子？}
{281}{}{主教呢？}
{282}{}{还有什么我该知道的吗？}
{283}{}{谢谢你，姐妹。}
{284}{}{非常抱歉。我能告诉你的都告诉你了。}
{285}{}{许多事情我都能确定。那些答案只能我们自已去寻找。不要被谣言所迷惑，再见。}
{286}{}{欢迎你，先生。}
{287}{}{欢迎你，小姐。}
{288}{}{世界很有可能已经陷入混沌，世界需要秩序，否则将不会幸存。我们要为世界带来秩序，不让怪物再次伤害它，如同它们在大毁灭中做的一样。考虑一下吧，再见。}
{289}{}{他们将自己的私心凌驾于人类的福祉之上的。而大毁灭就是源自人类的私心。如果世界要生存，一定要把这种疯狂从人的心中清除掉。再见。}
{290}{}{}
{291}{}{}

{293}{}{}
{294}{}{那个助祭～奥利弗；噢～她不在，神父～皮诺切特～他也没空。我本来不想提拉舍尔神父的，但是他似乎上唯一的人选了。好吧，我想你会找到他的。祝你好运。}
{295}{}{死亡从不是一种义务，即使它是必需的。再见先生。}
{296}{}{死亡从不是一种义务，即使它是必须的。再见小姐。}
{297}{}{有时候我也对他感到惊讶。但我肯定，对他的指控证据还是不足的。也许你应该和孩子们谈谈。}
{298}{}{【完成】}
{299}{}{我走了。}

{300}{}{我们之前也招收了很多新学员，但是最近大教堂要准备大规模的圣战，所以在人员的选择上会更加严格。但是，要坚定信仰，忍耐是一种美德。祝你好远，我的朋友。}

{302}{}{据我所知，我们没有使用圣火的计划。圣火之所以神圣，在于它给予了我们一次完美世界的机会。是我们的事业让圣火更加神圣。我们要将邪恶转化为善良的工具。正如你用武器保护自己，我们用武器保护世界。再会，朋友。}

{304}{}{我们为人们提供多项服务。痊愈伤者，发送食物给饥饿的人，教给年轻人知识。我们相当引以为豪。如果你能见到墨菲斯，他能够告诉你怎样在收容所里工作。再会，朋友。}
