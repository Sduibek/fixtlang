# {100}{}{You see Cabbot, an Initiate of the Brotherhood of Steel.}
# {101}{Cab_1}{Hello and welcome to the Brotherhood of Steel.
#  May I ask your business here?}
# {102}{}{Who're you?}
# {103}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
# {104}{}{Uhhh?}
# {105}{}{I'd like to join.}
# {106}{}{What do you do?}
# {107}{}{Never mind, thanks.}
# {108}{Cab_2}{Uh, I'm Cabbot, but uh, you didn't answer me. What can
#  I do for you? }
# {109}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
# {110}{}{Oh yeah, as if you'd like to know.}
# {111}{}{I'd like to join.}
# {112}{}{What do you do?}
# {113}{}{Never mind, thanks.}
# {114}{Cab_4}{That's great! Uh, W-Wait here a second and let me see what you need to do!}
# {115}{Cab_5}{Uh, well, I talked to the High Elder, and he said that not just anyone can
#  join. He, um, he said you have to complete a quest first. }
# {116}{}{Like what?}
# {117}{}{Never mind, see you later.}
# {118}{}{Did you do a quest before you joined?}
# {119}{Cab_5a}{Uh, not exactly. But things are a bit different right now. }
# {120}{}{So what's the quest?}
# {121}{}{So tell me what's different.}
# {122}{}{Never mind then, I'll come back another time.}
# {123}{Cab_6}{You have to go to the ruins of the Ancient Order. That's south
#  of here. Uh, you've gotta go inside and bring back something that
#  proves that you were there.}
# {124}{}{How will you know if it is from inside this place?}
# {125}{}{Okay.}
# {126}{}{No way in hell.}
# {127}{Cab_7}{This place is high tech. There's things inside like you've never
#  seen before. Oh, uh, it's also radioactive. Aheh.}
# {128}{}{Okay, I'll do it.}
# {129}{}{Sounds scary. Count me out.}
# {130}{Cab_9}{You'll do it? You will? Great! Just bring it back here! Good Luck.}
# {131}{Cab_10}{Oh . . . okay, then.  Goodbye. }
# {132}{Cab_12}{Well uh, I'm an Initiate. Right now, my job is to greet people at the door.}
# {133}{}{Doesn't sound terribly exciting, but I still want to
#  join the Brotherhood.}
# {134}{}{Okay, thanks. See you around.}
# {135}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
# {136}{Cab_16}{Well uh, I have to ask. It's my job.}
# {137}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
# {138}{}{Can I join the Brotherhood?}
# {139}{}{I don't have to tell you anything. Go get your commander.}
# {140}{}{Well then, I'll just be going now.}
# {141}{Cab_17}{I'm sorry, I really can't. Th-They said not to. Goodbye!}
# {142}{Cab_18}{No! Go away! }
# {143}{Cab_19g}{Well, hello again. You decide what you wanted?}
# {144}{Cab_19n}{Hello. What do you need now?}
# {145}{}{I've changed my mind. I want to join the Brotherhood.}
# {146}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
# {147}{}{Never mind. Goodbye.}
# {148}{Cab_20}{You're making fun of me, aren't you? Good-bye! }
# {149}{Cab_21}{Go away!}
# {150}{}{Please, I'm sorry I made you angry. Can we try again?}
# {151}{}{Okay.}
# {152}{Cab_22}{No! I think you're just lying to me. Goodbye!}
# {153}{Cab_23}{Hmmm. All right, I'll believe you for now. So what do you want?}
# {154}{}{I've changed my mind. I want to join the Brotherhood.}
# {155}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
# {156}{}{Never mind. Goodbye.}
# {157}{Cab_24}{Hey! You're back! Did you get something?}
# {158}{}{Yep, sure did.}
# {159}{}{No, I didn't yet.}
# {160}{Cab_25}{Great! But . . . um . . . the High Elder said you have
#  to give it to me first before you can be let in. Sorry.}
# {161}{}{Okay.}
# {162}{}{No, I don't want to.}
# {163}{Cab_27}{This is great! Hang on while I open the door.}
# {164}{}{OK.}
# {165}{Cab_28}{Hmmm . . . Sorry, but, uh, this could have come from anywhere.}
# {166}{}{But . . .}
# {167}{Cab_30}{Alright, so I'm gonna let you in. But I'm gonna tell ya' what's going on
#  after I do that. Alright? I'll be in the guard room. You can let yourself out, but I have
#  to let you back in. Oh, and the High Elder wants to speak with
#  you in the war room. It's on the third floor.}
# {168}{Cab_31}{You don't need to lie. Just come back when you have something.}
# {169}{Cab_32}{Well, let me know when you do.}
# {170}{Cab_33g}{Hello! You want back in?}
# {171}{Cab_33b}{Are you coming back in?}
# {172}{Cab_33n}{You want back in?}
# {173}{}{Yes, please.}
# {174}{}{If you'd open the gate.}
# {175}{Cab_34g}{Great! See you around, huh?}
# {176}{Cab_34b}{Fine.}
# {177}{Cab_34n}{Okay.}
# {178}{}{What exactly do you do?}
# {179}{}{Heard any good rumors lately?}
# {180}{}{Goodbye, Cabbot.}
# {181}{Cab_35a}{Go ahead.}
# {182}{Cab_36g}{Well hello! What can I help you with?}
# {183}{Cab_36b}{What do you need?}
# {184}{Cab_36n}{Can I help you with something?}
# {185}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
# {186}{}{Never mind. Goodbye.}
# {187}{Cab_37}{Goodbye.}
# {188}{Cab_38}{I greet people at the gates and decide whether to let them in. You
#  and the merchants are about the only ones that get in now, because the
#  Elders seem like they're preparing for something.}
# {189}{}{Do you know what it could be all about?}
# {190}{}{Why do you let the merchants in?}
# {191}{Cab_39}{Uh . . . I don't know, but uh, I've heard the High Elder arguing with the other
#  Elders. }
# {192}{}{Can I ask you a few more questions?}
# {193}{}{Thanks. I'll see you around.}
# {194}{Cab_40}{Why do I let 'em in? Well . . . we have to get our food and other things.  We trade our weapons for
#  all that.}
# {195}{}{Why don't you just grow food yourselves?}
# {196}{}{Can I ask you a few more questions?}
# {197}{}{Thanks. I'll see you around.}
# {198}{Cab_41}{Uh, well, the purpose of this place is to make Scribes and Knights. Anyone
#  who wants to be something else just leaves.}
# {199}{}{Oh. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
# {200}{}{Thanks. I'll see you around.}
# {201}{Cab_42}{Well, some of the Initiates think we're preparing for war. That's why
#  hardly anyone gets in now. I was surprised when the High Elder
#  told me to let you in.}
# {202}{}{Why?}
# {203}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
# {204}{}{Thanks for the info. I'll see you around.}
# {205}{Cab_43}{I don't think that belongs to you.}
# {206}{Cab_44}{I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to go tell the guards.}
# {207}{Cab_45}{I don't think you should be doing that.}
# {208}{Cab_46a}{Oh, okay. Whatever.}
# {209}{Cab_47}{As I said . . .}
# {210}{Cab_48}{Well, as I said . . .}
# {211}{Cab_49}{As I've said before . . .}
# {212}{Cab_50}{Well, it's like I said . . .}
# {213}{Cab_51}{Now, um, I ha- I hate to be rude, but I don't like to repeat myself.
#  Okay?}
# {214}{}{Um, ya know, I really don't have time to sit here and repeat
#  myself over and over again. You can understand, can't you?}

#   likes being High Elder much.}

#  to step in a lot.}
# {220}{Cab_58}{OK, well, scribes are the keepers of all the histories and the blueprints
#  for the weapons we make. I just love books; that's why I want to
#  be one . . . a Scribe, that is.}
# {221}{Cab_59}{Well, you see, they're the ones who want to become protectors
#  of the Brotherhood. There's not many of them, but they train their
#  whole lives to become Paladins.}
# {222}{Cab_60}{That's the town to the south, right? We get the merchants here all
#  the time, but I've never been there myself. Gee, I wouldn't know
#  what to do in a big city like that.}
# {223}{Cab_61}{You should talk to Vree, I think. She'll tell ya' about 'em.}
# {224}{Cab_62}{They trade with us for food and stuff. We give them weapons.
#  They don't come around too often anymore, but uh, I don't know why.}
# {225}{Cab_63}{Whoa, that's a long story. Go to the library and talk to Vree.
#  She'll be able to show you where the history CDs are.}
# {226}{Cab_64}{Oh, well, in the Exodus, the Brotherhood split into two groups.  The
#  group that broke away robbed the others of some of the weapons
#  an-and they went south.  Then about ten years ago we sent out knights to look
#  for them and all they found was ruins.  No one knows what happened.}
# {227}{Cab_65}{The ancient Brotherhood came from some place far up north a long,

# {229}{Cab_67}{Hmm . . . I don't know. You might want to ask someone more important

# {230}{Cab_68}{I don't know what that is. You might want to ask around.}
# {231}{}{Go talk to Mathia. She'll tell you more about that.}

{101}{Cab_1}{你好，欢迎来到钢铁兄弟会。请问你有何贵干？}
{102}{}{你是？}
{103}{}{我能问你几个问题吗？}
{104}{}{唔?}
{105}{}{我要加入你们！}
{106}{}{你在这里做什么？}
{107}{}{没事，回见。}
{108}{Cab_2}{呃，我是卡波特。你没回答我的问题，你来这里做什么？}
{109}{}{我想问你几个问题。}
{110}{}{啊哈，你还真想知道啊。}
{111}{}{我要加入你们！}
{112}{}{你在这里做什么？}
{113}{}{没事，回见。}
{114}{Cab_4}{太好了！呃，你……你等一下，我来想想你能帮我做些啥。}
{115}{Cab_5}{唔，这个，我和高级元老反映了情况，他说不是什么人都能入会的。他呢，嗯，他说你必须要先证明自己。}
{116}{}{比如说?}
{117}{}{算了，再见。}
{118}{}{你当年也是先做事情再加入的?}
{119}{Cab_5a}{这个，我倒没有。不过现在情况不同了。}
{120}{}{说，想让我干啥?}
{121}{}{有何不同？}
{122}{}{算了，下次准备好了我再来。}
{123}{Cab_6}{你要到南方的一个古代机构的遗迹去。进去后拿回一件能证明你去过那里的东西。}
{124}{}{你怎么分辨我拿回的东西是不是属于那里的？}
{125}{}{成交。}
{126}{}{没门。}
{127}{Cab_7}{那个地方有高科技。里面的东西你这辈子都没见过。呃，对了，辐射很大的。}
{128}{}{好，我同意。}
{129}{}{好怕怕，我不干。}
{130}{Cab_9}{你愿意？真的？太棒了！把东西拿回这里！祝你好运。}
{131}{Cab_10}{哦……那么好吧。再见了。}
{132}{Cab_12}{这个嘛，呃，我是新兵，现在的任务是看门。}
{133}{}{好像很无聊嘛，不过我还是要加入你们！}
{134}{}{哦，多谢，我走了。}
{135}{}{能问你几个问题吗？}
{136}{Cab_16}{呃，当然，我必须要问清楚，这是我的工作！}
{137}{}{能问你几个问题吗？}
{138}{}{我可以加入兄弟会吗？}
{139}{}{我不想告诉你任何事情，把你们的长官叫来！}
{140}{}{算啦，我马上闪人。}
{141}{Cab_17}{抱歉，我不能多说什么，他们不准我乱说，送客！}
{142}{Cab_18}{不！你赶紧滚！}
{143}{Cab_19g}{啊，又见面了，你打定主意了？}
{144}{Cab_19n}{你好，你又想做什么？}
{145}{}{我想好了，我要加入兄弟会。}
{146}{}{能问你几个问题吗？}
{147}{}{算了，回见。}
{148}{Cab_20}{你想耍我啊，是不是！滚！}
{149}{Cab_21}{滚蛋!}
{150}{}{不好意思，我失礼了，我们再谈点什么吧。}
{151}{}{就这样吧。}
{152}{Cab_22}{不行，你刚才想晃点我，你走！}
{153}{Cab_23}{唔，好吧，再信你一次，你究竟想怎么样？}
{154}{}{我想好了，我要加入你们！}
{155}{}{能问你几个问题吗？}
{156}{}{算了，回见。}
{157}{Cab_24}{嘿！你回来啦！找到什么东西了？}
{158}{}{那是，当然了。}
{159}{}{没呢，还在找。}
{160}{Cab_25}{你真强！对了，呃，元老说你必须先上缴这个我才能让你进去，冒犯了。}
{161}{}{好的。}
{162}{}{这可不行。}
{163}{Cab_27}{太好了！你稍等，我去开门。}
{164}{}{没问题。}
{165}{Cab_28}{嗯……抱歉，这个东西是哪里都能捡到的。}
{166}{}{不是吧……}
{167}{Cab_30}{好了，你可以进去了。但是我要和你说说以后的进出问题。明白？我在守卫室，你可以自己开门出来，但必须由我开门让你进。还有，高级元老们想见见你，他们在第三层的作战室。}
{168}{Cab_31}{别想忽悠我，等你找到东西再来吧。}
{169}{Cab_32}{好吧，什么时候你好了就跟我说。}
{170}{Cab_33g}{哈罗，你想下去？}
{171}{Cab_33b}{你想下基地去？}
{172}{Cab_33n}{你想下去？}
{173}{}{是的，请开门。}
{174}{}{劳驾开门。}
{175}{Cab_34g}{好！回见啦。}
{176}{Cab_34b}{好。}
{177}{Cab_34n}{好的。}
{178}{}{你到底是做什么的？}
{179}{}{最近有什么好玩的小道消息？}
{180}{}{再见，卡波特。}
{181}{Cab_35a}{说。}
{182}{Cab_36g}{哈罗！我能帮你吗。}
{183}{Cab_36b}{你想要什么？}
{184}{Cab_36n}{我能帮你做些什么吗？}
{185}{}{我想问你几个问题。}
{186}{}{没事，回见。}
{187}{Cab_37}{再见。}
{188}{Cab_38}{我欢迎来客，为他们放行。除了你和那些商人，最近都没什么人来这里。元老们似乎在准备什么行动。}
{189}{}{你知道他们在准备什么吗？}
{190}{}{商人为什么可以进到这里？}
{191}{Cab_39}{这个……我也不知道，但是，我听说最高元老和其他元老最近好像在争论什么。}
{192}{}{我能再问几个问题么？}
{193}{}{多谢。再见。}
{194}{Cab_40}{他们为什么可以进去？呃……我们需要食品和其他货物，我们用武器和他们交换。}
{195}{}{你们为啥就不能自己种庄稼？}
{196}{}{我能再问几个问题吗？}
{197}{}{多谢。再见。}
{198}{Cab_41}{嗯，这个地方的目的是训练研究员和骑士。其他人不会对这里有兴趣的。}
{199}{}{我能再问几个问题吗？}
{200}{}{多谢。再见。}
{201}{Cab_42}{有些新兵说我们正在备战。可能就是因为这个所以没人来上门吧。我也很奇怪，最高元老会居然让你进去。}
{202}{}{为什么？}
{203}{}{多谢。我能再问几个问题吗？}
{204}{}{多谢你的信息。再见。}
{205}{Cab_43}{我觉得这不是你的。}
{206}{Cab_44}{抱歉，我要向守卫汇报。}
{207}{Cab_45}{你真不该这样做。}
{208}{Cab_46a}{哦，对，随你怎么说。}
{209}{Cab_47}{我说过……}
{210}{Cab_48}{呃，我说过的……}
{211}{Cab_49}{我以前和你说过……}
{212}{Cab_50}{正如我所说……}
{213}{Cab_51}{听着，我不想失礼，但是我真的不想再重复我的话了，明白？}
{214}{}{唔，要知道，我没时间站在这里和你重复重复再重复。你听明白了？}
{215}{Cab_53}{我就是啊。}
{216}{Cab_54}{她是首席研究员，通常在图书馆里。下到地下室，在你的右手边。}
{217}{Cab_55}{骑士们说他是一个坚强的领导，我个人没觉得，因为，我跟着弗蕾学习，要当一名研究员。}
{218}{Cab_56}{马克松将军以前是骑士。我想他不太喜欢担当最高元老的职务。}
{219}{Cab_57}{他们统管这里的一切，从我们的吃住到任务分派。对了，他们经常争吵。最高元老似乎也不太愿意搀和进来。}
{220}{Cab_58}{嗯，研究员是历史文档和武器设计图纸的保管人。我喜欢看书，所以我想当一名……研究员，呃，没错。}
{221}{Cab_59}{他们想成为兄弟会的守护者。人虽不多，但都全身心训练，想成为一名游侠。}
{222}{Cab_60}{南边的城市，是吧？我们这里经常有来自那儿的商人，但我从来没去过。唉，我也不知道在那个大城市里该做什么。}
{223}{Cab_61}{你问弗蕾吧，我想她会告诉你的。}
{224}{Cab_62}{他们卖给我们粮食和其他物资，我们卖给他们武器。他们最近来的不勤，我也不知道为什么。}
{225}{Cab_63}{嚯，那就说来话长了。去图书馆问弗蕾。她会给你看我们的历史资料碟片的。}
{226}{Cab_64}{大迁徙后，兄弟会分成两派，离开的那派抢走了些武器，往南走。十年前，我们派了些骑士去找他们，只看到一些遗迹。没人知道出了什么事。}
{227}{Cab_65}{兄弟会最早的时候是从很北边的地方过来的。我们管这叫做大迁徙，你可以从图书馆弗蕾那里了解更多。}
{228}{Cab_66}{唔……这个我不知道。}
{229}{Cab_67}{嗯……不清楚，你问问上头的人吧。}
{230}{Cab_68}{不知道。你自己多问问其他人。}
{231}{}{去找马蒂雅，她会告诉你更多。}
{232}{}{你成为新兵，获得2000点经验值。}
{233}{}{这里不需要你这种货色，滚！}

{1100}{Cab_53}{我就是啊。}
{1101}{Cab_54}{她是首席研究员，通常在图书馆里。下到地下室，在你的右手边。}
{1102}{Cab_55}{骑士们说他是一个坚强的领导，我个人没觉得，因为，我跟着弗蕾学习，要当一名研究员。}
{1103}{Cab_56}{马克松将军以前是骑士。我想他不太喜欢担当最高元老的职务。}
{1104}{Cab_57}{他们统管这里的一切，从我们的吃住到任务分派。对了，他们经常争吵。最高元老似乎也不太愿意搀和进来。}
{1105}{Cab_58}{嗯，研究员是历史文档和武器设计图纸的保管人。我喜欢看书，所以我想当一名……研究员，呃，没错。}
{1106}{Cab_59}{他们想成为兄弟会的守护者。人虽不多，但都全身心训练，想成为一名游侠。}
{1107}{Cab_60}{南边的城市，是吧？我们这里经常有来自那儿的商人，但我从来没去过。唉，我也不知道在那个大城市里该做什么。}
{1108}{Cab_61}{你问弗蕾吧，我想她会告诉你的。}
{1109}{Cab_62}{他们卖给我们粮食和其他物资，我们卖给他们武器。他们最近来的不勤，我也不知道为什么。}
{1110}{Cab_63}{嚯，那就说来话长了。去图书馆问弗蕾。她会给你看我们的历史磁盘的。}
{1111}{Cab_64}{大迁徙后，兄弟会分成两派，离开的那派抢走了些武器，往南走。十年前，我们派了些骑士去找他们，只看到一些遗迹。没人知道出了什么事。}
{1112}{Cab_65}{兄弟会最早的时候是从很北边的地方过来的。我们管这叫做大迁徙，你可以从图书馆弗蕾那里了解更多。}
{1113}{Cab_53}{我就是啊。}
{1114}{Cab_64}{大迁徙后，兄弟会分成两派，离开的那派抢走了些武器，往南走。十年前，我们派了些骑士去找他们，只看到一些遗迹。没人知道出了什么事。}
{1115}{Cab_20}{你想耍我啊，是不是！滚！}
{1116}{Cab_67}{嗯……不清楚，你问问上头的人吧。}
{1117}{Cab_63}{嚯，那就说来话长了。去图书馆问弗蕾。她会给你看我们的历史磁盘的。}
{1118}{Cab_67}{嗯……不清楚，你问问上头的人吧。}
{1119}{Cab_62}{他们卖给我们粮食和其他物资，我们卖给他们武器。他们最近来的不勤，我也不知道为什么。}
{1120}{Cab_66}{唔……这个我不知道。}
{1121}{Cab_61}{你问弗蕾吧，我想她会告诉你的。}
