#{100}{}{You see a Paladin guard.}
#{101}{}{Pssst, see any good deals?}
#{102}{}{Sorry, I'm on duty. Can't talk right now.}
#{103}{}{What a nice day. I hope we don't have any attacks today.}
#{104}{}{Some of these Caravan traders are a little strange.}
#{105}{}{Good day.}
#{106}{}{Hi there, good looking.}
#{107}{}{Greetings, initiate.}
#{108}{}{If you have any questions about our order, you should
#talk to Cabbot, over by the door.}
#{109}{}{Cabbot is the one you want to talk to; he's the
#young lad by the door.}
#{110}{}{Pssst, see any good deals?}
#{111}{}{If you're here to trade you're talking to the wrong person.}
#{112}{}{What?}
#{113}{}{Don't bother me, worm.}
#{114}{}{Do I look like I'm interested in anything you might have
#to offer?}
#{115}{}{Hmph. The nerve.}
#{116}{}{Initiate, you should know better than to bother us while
#we're on watch.}
#{117}{}{If you have any questions about the Order, you should
#talk to Cabbot, by the door.}
#{118}{}{Initiate, shouldn't you be doing something useful?}
#{119}{}{I don't think you should be here, stranger.}
{100}{}{你看见一个游侠警卫。}
{101}{}{咳，看看有什么好货？}
{102}{}{对不起，我在值班。现在不能谈话。}
{103}{}{好天气。我希望我们今天不要有任何行动。}
{104}{}{有些商队的人怪怪的。}
{105}{}{日安。}
{106}{}{嗨，气色不错。}
{107}{}{你好，新兵。}
{108}{}{如果你对我们的命令有任何疑问，可以去问守门的卡波特。}
{109}{}{你是来找卡波特的吧，门口那个年轻人就是。}
{110}{}{咳，看看有什么好货？}
{111}{}{如果你打算交易那你找错人了。}
{112}{}{什么？}
{113}{}{不要搔扰我，可怜虫。}
{114}{}{你认为我会对你的那点东西感兴趣吗？}
{115}{}{咳，神经。}
{116}{}{新兵，你应该知道在我们忙着的时候不喜欢被打扰。}
{117}{}{如果你对我们的命令有任何疑问，可以去问卡波特，他在门口。}
{118}{}{新兵，你不能做点有用的事吗？}
{119}{}{我想这不是你该呆的地方，陌生人。}
