#{115}{}{Ah, the fool finally realizes something.}
{115}{}{啊哈，傻瓜最后还是开了点窍。}

#{116}{}{Words will only do so much. This will solve more.}
{116}{}{废话就只能到此为止了。这个更管用。}

#{117}{}{I begin to think you may have a bit of superior blood in you yet. Let me find out for certain.}
{117}{}{我觉得你身上可能还有一些高级血统。我要确认一下。}

#{118}{}{He does indeed, for death shall be your saving grace.}
{118}{}{他的确做了, 死亡将是你最为可取之处。}

#{119}{}{The simplest of proofs for you. I am smarter, stronger, and quicker than you are. Would you care for a test of my skills?}

#{130}{}{Offered all the power in the world and still frightened. I will help you with your decision.}
{130}{}{就是掌握了全世界的力量还是惊恐不安的，我来帮你下决心吧。}

#{131}{}{Comments such as those only prove how much more intelligent i am than you. Now, you shall pay for your insolence!}
{131}{}{你的话正好证明了我比你更聪明。现在，你将为你的傲慢无礼付出代价！}

#{132}{}{Do you accept credit cards, or only caps?}
{132}{}{收信用卡，还是只要现金？}
