{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{主教的副官可以告诉你：Unity－“同一”、FEV－“FEV”、Master－主教、Cathedral－大教堂、Vats－病毒槽、Normals－正常人、Vaults－避难所、Morpheus－墨菲斯、Virus－病毒}

#{100}{}{You see the Lieutenant of the Master's army.}
{100}{}{你看见主教军队的副官。}

#{101}{LIEUT1}{Now what do we have here? I've been told you wish to divulge information of the utmost importance. I do hope so.}
{101}{LIEUT1}{让我看看这是谁来了？我听说你愿意透露非常重要的情报，希望如此。}

#{102}{}{Uh, yeah.}
{102}{}{唔，是的。}

#{103}{}{Not to someone as ugly as you.}
{103}{}{不跟你这样的丑八怪说。}

#{104}{}{On one condition.}
{104}{}{我有个条件。}

#{105}{}{Doh!}
{105}{}{去你的！}

#{106}{LIEUT1A}{An insult. How droll. I'd define that word for you,
# but that would be a waste, wouldn't it. Let's get to your two choices:
# You can tell me what I want to know. Or I can do it . . . my way.}
{106}{LIEUT1A}{侮辱。多滑稽，我会替你解释那个词，不过，那将是浪费，就不用了。我给你两条路: 你说出我想知道的东西。或者我让你说……用我的方式。}

#{107}{}{I'll take 'none of the above.'}
{107}{}{这两条路，我一个都不要。}

#{108}{}{Okay, but on one condition.}
{108}{}{好的，但我有个条件。}

#{109}{}{All right, I'll tell you. It's on the other side of the mountains, far to the north. You'll find it near a strange, half-dome type rock . . . Now, what do I get?}
{109}{}{好的，我告诉你。它在山脉的另一边，往北很远的地方。你会在一块奇怪的，半圆形岩石的附近找到它……现在，给我什么回报？}

#{110}{LIEUT1B}{I don't believe I offered. But I will give you my thanks for telling me where your Vault is. I'm sure the Master will be . . . ever so grateful.}
{110}{LIEUT1B}{我真不敢相信。不过，我会对你说出避难所在哪里表示我的谢意。我确信主教会……非常感谢你的。}

#{111}{LIEUT2}{How nice for us both. Now, if you please, the location of your Vault.}
{111}{LIEUT2}{这样对我们双方多好啊。现在，劳驾说出你们避难所的位置吧。}

#{112}{}{It's uh . . . it's uh . . .}
{112}{}{它在嗯……它在嗯……}

#{113}{}{On one condition, pal.}
{113}{}{伙计，我有个条件呢。}

#{114}{}{Fooled ya, didn't I? I'll never tell you!}
{114}{}{我耍你呢。我决不会告诉你！}

#{115}{}{Okay, okay! Just don't kill me! I'll tell you everything I know!}
{115}{}{好的，好的！不过，别杀我！我把知道的所有事情都告诉你！}

#{116}{LIEUT3}{Conditions? How delightful. Go ahead, amuse me with your . . . condition.}
{116}{LIEUT3}{条件吗？多令人高兴啊。继续说，让我乐一乐……谈谈你的条件。}

#{117}{}{I want to go free.}
{117}{}{我希望自由离开。}

#{118}{}{Put a bag over your head so I can stand being in your presence.}
{118}{}{用麻袋套住你的头，那样我就能站在你面前不用看你的脸了。}

#{119}{}{I want to be able to ask you some questions first.}
{119}{}{我希望可以先问你几个问题。}

#{120}{LIEUT4}{What a splendid sense of humor. Pity I don't have one. So . . . the location of your Vault, if you please.}
{120}{LIEUT4}{多么富有幽默感啊。可惜我没有。那么……劳驾说出你的避难所的位置吧。}

#{121}{}{All right, but can I ask you some questions first?}
{121}{}{好的，但我能先问你几个问题吗？}

#{122}{}{I'm not telling and you can't make me.}
{122}{}{我不说你也强迫不了我。}

#{123}{}{It's uh . . . it's uh . . .}
{123}{}{它在嗯……它在唔……}

#{124}{LIEUT5}{Why certainly, my dear human. I'm curious just to see what you'll ask.}
{124}{LIEUT5}{那当然可以，我亲爱的人类。我正想听听你会问些什么。}

#{125}{}{What is it you do here?}
{125}{}{你们在这里做些什么？}

#{126}{}{Who do you work for?}
{126}{}{你在替谁效力？}

#{127}{}{What do you want me for?}
{127}{}{你们要我干什么？}

#{128}{}{How about I just leave now.}
{128}{}{现在就让我离开怎么样？}

#{129}{LIEUT7}{My dear human, this is the great procreator! Here we'll make others of the master race and insure the Unity. It's all quite glorious, I assure you.}
{129}{LIEUT7}{我亲爱的人类，这是伟大的创造者！在这里我们生产“主宰之族”的成员，确保我们的“同一”事业得以成功。我敢保证，它是无上光荣的。}

#{130}{}{Tell me about the Unity.}
{130}{}{给我说说关于“同一”的事情。}

#{131}{}{Sounds like it. Why do you need all this to, uh, procreate?}
{131}{}{听起来象那么回事。你们为什么需要所有这些东西来，嗯，生产？}

#{132}{}{So, who's in charge?}
{132}{}{那么，谁是主管？}

#{133}{LIEUT8}{Presently, there is a slight . . . problem in the reproductive process. It's being attended to. For now, we must use the Vats to turn humans into Super Mutants. You'll experience that glory yourself momentarily.}
{133}{LIEUT8}{目前，生产过程有一点小小的……麻烦。我们正在努力解决。眼下，我们必须利用病毒槽把人类转变成超级变种人。那份光荣你即刻就会亲身体验到。}

#{134}{}{Oh, goody. A few more questions before I . . . glow?}
{134}{}{哦，好呀。在我体验光荣之前……再问你几个问题，好吗？}

#{135}{lieut8a}{How could I possibly refuse a request phrased like that?}
{135}{lieut8a}{我怎么可能拒绝这样的要求呢？}

#{136}{LIEUT9}{Certainly. We have all the time in the world . . . Trust me.}
{136}{LIEUT9}{当然。我们有的是时间……相信我。}

#{137}{LIEUT10}{The Unity is our goal. It is quite simple, really. Certainly, even you have noticed the steady downhill slide of civilization?}
{137}{LIEUT10}{“同一”是我们的目标。它是十分简单的，真的。当然，甚至你也注意到了人类文明的逐步衰落吧？}

#{138}{}{Well ,yeah, but . . .}
{138}{}{嗯，是的，不过……}

#{139}{LIEUT11}{The Super Mutant is the next advancement in human evolution. To save the world, we will convert all the worthy individuals. Simple, efficient, glorious.}
{139}{LIEUT11}{超级变种人是人类进化的又一次进步。为了拯救世界，我们会转变一切有价值的个体。简单，有效，光荣。}

#{140}{}{So you're making everyone into big, green, ugly mutants to save the world?}
{140}{}{那你们正在把每个人都变成大块头的、绿色的、丑陋的变种人来拯救世界？}

#{141}{}{How are you more advanced?}
{141}{}{你们怎么就更先进呢？}

#{142}{}{But there's no choice involved.}
{142}{}{你们没有给予他人选择的机会。}

#{143}{LIEUT12}{Your human mind is rather under-equipped to handle this, so a simple yes will suffice for now. Soon everyone in the world will be converted, and peace will reign.}
{143}{LIEUT12}{你的人类头脑理解这些是相当吃力的，因此简单地答复一句“是”就够了。不久，世界上的每个人都将会转变，和平会统治一切。}

#{144}{}{But what about free will?}
{144}{}{但是，自由的意志在哪里呢？}

#{145}{}{You're telling me there will be no war?}
{145}{}{你是告诉我没有战争吗？}

#{146}{LIEUT13}{Did you make the choice to be born into this ash covered world? We, the Super Mutants, are the best prepared for the world to come. What is free choice compared to life?}
{146}{LIEUT13}{当你出生于这个堆满辐射灰烬的世界时，你有得选择吗？我们，超级变种人，最适应即将到来的世界。与生命相比较，自由的选择算什么呢？}

#{147}{}{Debatable point. But how are you more prepared than normal humans?}
{147}{}{不敢苟同。你们怎么就比正常的人类更适应呢？}

#{148}{}{But it's evil to force people to live your way!.}
{148}{}{可是逼迫人们按你们的方式生存是邪恶的！}

#{149}{LIEUT14}{Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer. We are highly intelligent and immune to disease. The strong survive! It is our goal to improve the human race.}
{149}{LIEUT14}{随便找个人来，他也会一眼就看出那是显而易见的客观事实。我们智商高，对疾病免疫，我们是强大的生存者！改进人种是我们的目标。}

#{150}{}{Pretty lofty goal. How are you made like this?}
{150}{}{相当崇高的目标。你们怎么变成这个样子的？}

#{151}{LIEUT15}{Ahh, the wonders of technology. Before the war, the human scientists made a drug called FEV. It was designed to make the perfect human.}
{151}{LIEUT15}{啊哈，科学技术的奇迹。战前，人类的科学家制造了一种药品叫做FEV。它是设计用来创造完美的人类。}

#{152}{}{So you're the perfect human?}
{152}{}{那你们是完美的人类吗？}

#{153}{LIEUT16}{Better. More than human. I, too, was once human. Like you, I was a slug, wallowing in the mud before being exposed to FEV and undergoing my glorious transformation.}
{153}{LIEUT16}{比人类更好些。我，曾经也是人类。象你一样，在感染FEV病毒之前，我也是一条在泥浆里打滚的鼻滴虫，直到经历我光荣的改造。}

#{154}{}{So you're planning on dipping everyone in this FEV?}
{154}{}{那你们计划在这种FEV药水中浸泡每个人吗？}

#{155}{LIEUT17}{Exactly. Now you see.}
{155}{LIEUT17}{没错。现在你明白了。}

#{156}{}{Uh, sure I do. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{156}{}{嗯，确实是的。我能再问个问题吗？}

#{157}{}{But it's wrong!}
{157}{}{但它是错误的！}

#{158}{LIEUT18}{Oh, how disappointing. I'd so hoped you would see the light before . . . Well, when you are one of us, I'm certain you'll understand. Then you'll embrace the Unity.}
{158}{LIEUT18}{哦，真令人失望。我原来还挺希望你能明白的……唔，没关系，当你成为我们的一员，我肯定你会理解的。那时候你就会拥护“同一”事业的。}

#{159}{}{Never! It's evil. Evil, I tell you!}
{159}{}{决不！它是邪恶的。邪恶的，我告诉你！}

#{160}{}{Maybe. Can I ask you a few more questions first?}
{160}{}{或许吧。我能多问几个问题吗？}

#{161}{LIEUT19}{No war and no sickness. All Super Mutants are bound by the Unity. We are the hope for the world.}
{161}{LIEUT19}{没有战争，没有疾病。所有的超级变种人因为“同一”结合在一起。我们是世界的希望。}

#{162}{}{Sounds delusional to me.}
{162}{}{听起来怎么像是你们的意淫呢。}

#{163}{}{How are you the hope of the world?}
{163}{}{你们怎么就成了世界的希望呢？}

#{164}{LIEUT20}{We all work for the Master to uphold the glory of the Unity. He was the first, you see.}
{164}{LIEUT20}{我们都替主教效力，维护“同一”的荣耀。你知道的，他是先知。}

#{165}{}{How did you come to work for him?}
{165}{}{你怎么会来替他效力？}

#{166}{}{What's the Unity?}
{166}{}{“同一”是怎么回事？}

#{167}{LIEUT21}{Fate. Luck of the draw. I was the strongest of my batch to be dipped in the virus, and I have always supported the ideals of the Unity and the Master, for he is right. And for my devotion, I have been rewarded.}
{167}{LIEUT21}{命运。幸运之神的垂青。我是我那一批浸泡在病毒中最强壮的一个，我自始至终拥护“同一”的理想和我们的主教，因为他是正确的。由于我的付出，我获得了回报。}

#{168}{}{What virus?}
{168}{}{什么病毒？}

#{169}{}{So what's this Master like?}
{169}{}{那这个主教象什么样呢？}

#{170}{LIEUT22}{Before the war, the humans made a virus called FEV to create the perfect man. They were successful, as you can plainly see. The Master has been the first to truly utilize the FEV to its full potential.}
{170}{LIEUT22}{战前，人们合成了名叫FEV的病毒来创造完美的人类。他们成功了，显然正如你见到的一样。主教是真正发挥FEV全部潜力的第一个。}

#{171}{}{So where is this Master?}
{171}{}{那这个主教在哪里呢？}

#{172}{}{How does it work?}
{172}{}{它是如何起作用的？}

#{173}{LIEUT23}{He's busy with the Children of the Cathedral. They actually consider us gods. But then, who can blame them.}
{173}{LIEUT23}{他正忙于大教堂教徒的事务。教徒们还把我们当作神来敬拜。不过，谁能责怪他们呢？}

#{174}{}{My, aren't we conceited?}
{174}{}{我的天，你们不是狂妄吗？}

#{175}{}{You think you're gods?}
{175}{}{你认为你们是神吗？}

#{176}{LIEUT24}{Is honesty conceit? We're the next step in evolution. Through our Unity, the world will survive. Where is the conceit in that?}
{176}{LIEUT24}{诚实也能算是狂妄吗？我们是进化的下一个阶梯。通过我们的“同一”，世界幸存。就这点而言，那有什么狂妄呢？}

#{177}{}{How about inside that grotesque head of yours?}
{177}{}{你那颗怪脑袋里面到底装了些什么？}

#{178}{}{Well, whatever you say. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{178}{}{唔，你爱怎么说都行。我能再问几个问题吗？}

#{179}{LIEUT25}{Of course not. We are simply the future.}
{179}{LIEUT25}{当然不是。我们只不过是未来。}

#{180}{}{I don't believe you.}
{180}{}{我不信你。}

#{181}{}{Before the future comes, there're a couple of other things I'm curious about.}
{181}{}{在未来到来之前，我还有几件别的事情想知道。}

#{182}{LIEUT26}{Oh, I suspect that's far above your ability to comprehend. But not to worry. Soon your eyes will be opened to a whole new life.}
{182}{LIEUT26}{哦，我想那远远超出了你的理解能力。但是别担心。不久，你睁开眼睛看到的将是全新的生活。}

#{183}{}{What do you mean!?}
{183}{}{你什么意思！？}

#{184}{}{Before that happens, there's a couple of other things that I'm curious about.}
{184}{}{在那发生之前，我还有几件别的事情想知道。}

#{185}{LIEUT27}{【The Lieutenant sighs.】 Haven't you figured it out yet? You're a prime normal. Soon you'll be one of us.}
{185}{LIEUT27}{【叹气】你还没有觉悟吗？你是一个原始的普通人类。很快你就会成为我们中的一员。}

#{186}{}{How does 'no way' sound?}
{186}{}{“决不”，这个词听起来怎样？}

#{187}{}{Before I become a dip like you, there's a couple of other things that I'm curious about.}
{187}{}{在我成为一个你这样的浸泡人之前，我还有几件别的事情想知道。}

#{188}{}{Why am I a prime human ?}
{188}{}{为什么说我是一个原始的人类？}

#{189}{LIEUT28}{Go ahead, ask your questions. We are in no hurry.}
{189}{LIEUT28}{继续，问你的问题吧。我们不忙。}

#{190}{LIEUT29}{He was our guide to the life-giving virus, and he is Father to us all. And he so wants to meet you. I hope you're honored.}
{190}{LIEUT29}{他是我们的先驱，引导我们迎接赋予我们新生命的病毒，他是我们大家的创造者。他这么想见到你，我希望你感到光荣。}

#{191}{}{Uh . . . okay. What about that virus? What is it?}
{191}{}{唔……好的。那个病毒是怎样回事？它是什么？}

#{192}{}{Before bestowing this honor, how about answering more questions?}
{192}{}{在赋予这份光荣之前，回答我几个问题如何？}

#{193}{}{Where is he?}
{193}{}{他在哪里？}

#{194}{LIEUT30}{The FEV was mutated by the war radiation. Those living in this desolate wasteland have been exposed to this mutant FEV, essentially inoculating them from the full effects.}
{194}{LIEUT30}{FEV病毒在核战争的辐射下变异了。那些生活在荒凉废墟中的人类已经感染这些突变的FEV，从本质上来说，他们不能获得病毒的全部能效。}

#{195}{}{So?}
{195}{}{所以？}

#{196}{}{So you need those who are uncontaminated in order to make Super Mutants?}
{196}{}{所以你们需要那些未受感染的人类来制造超级变种人？}

#{197}{LIEUT31}{So, you're from a Vault and have limited exposure to this mutated virus. The original FEV in the Vats should work quite well on you.}
{197}{LIEUT31}{所以，由于你是来自于避难所，感染这种变异病毒的程度比较低。病毒槽里原来的FEV应该在你身上很好地发挥作用了。}

#{198}{}{And how do you know this?}
{198}{}{那你怎么会知道这些呢？}

#{199}{LIEUT32}{We have done extensive experiments on humans to reach this conclusion. My master has been searching for unopened Vaults to prove his theories. And now you've come along. How thoughtful of you.}
{199}{LIEUT32}{我们在人类的身上做了大量试验得出了这个结论。我的主教在寻找从未开放过的避难所来验证他的理论。而现在你出现了。你还真是体贴人啊。}

#{200}{}{You won't find it.}
{200}{}{你们不会找到它。}

#{201}{}{Well before that happens, there's a couple of other things that I'm curious about.}
{201}{}{唔，在那发生之前，我还有几件别的事情想知道。}

#{202}{LIEUT33}{Oh, my, you are brighter than I thought. Now you know why we need your Vault.}
{202}{LIEUT33}{哦，我的天，你比我想象的聪明。现在你知道我们为什么需要你的避难所了。}

#{203}{}{Too bad you won't get it.}
{203}{}{太糟了，你不会知道它。}

#{204}{}{It's a big Vault. How about some more small answers first?}
{204}{}{它是个大避难所，你先回答我几个小问题如何？}

#{205}{LIEUT34}{Going? I believe . . . let me check . . . Why, yes, I almost laughed! How wonderfully humorous. The only place you're going is the Vat. But first, you'll tell me where your Vault is.}
{205}{LIEUT34}{去哪里？我相信……让我看看……哎呀，是的，我几乎要笑了！你真是太幽默了。你唯一要去的地方是病毒槽。但首先，你要说出你们的避难所在哪里。}

#{206}{}{I hope you can take rejection.}
{206}{}{我希望你会接受我的拒绝。}

#{207}{LIEUT35}{We shall see, won't we?}
{207}{LIEUT35}{我们走着瞧吧，不是吗？}

#{208}{lieut35a}{Oddly enough, I do believe you do not intend to tell me. We'll have to correct that!}
{208}{lieut35a}{不知怎么，我总觉得你是不打算告诉我了。那我们不得不给你点颜色瞧瞧！}

#{209}{LIEUT36}{Feel better now? Since torture is such a crass, yet oddly satisfying and effective technique, I'll ask you once more nicely. Where . . . is . . . the Vault!}
{209}{LIEUT36}{现在感觉好些了吗？虽然拷打是这么的粗暴，但这个方法令人称奇的满意和有效，我现在客气地再问你一次。那个避难所～在～哪～里～？！}

#{210}{}{I'm. Not. Telling.}
{210}{}{我～不～说～}

#{211}{}{You win. It's across the mountains to the west. I'll draw you a map.}
{211}{}{你赢了。它在穿过山脉往西的地方，我会画张地图给你看。}

#{212}{LIEUT37}{I rather hoped you'd say that.}
{212}{LIEUT37}{我非常希望你会说出来。}

#{213}{LIEUT37b}{How was that? In a more . . . chatty mood? Now where were we? Oh, of course . . . the Vault.}
{213}{LIEUT37b}{怎么了？胡扯个没完了……？现在我们说到哪里了？哦，当然……那个避难所。}

#{214}{}{It's . . . it's . . . in your dreams.}
{214}{}{它是……它是……在你的梦里。}

#{215}{}{You win. It's across the mountains to the west. I'll draw you a map.}
{215}{}{你赢了。它在穿过山脉往西的地方，我会画张地图给你看。}

#{216}{LIEUT38}{Ah, I feel much better. And you? . . . Now, be a good little human and tell me where your Vault is. This is getting most tedious.}
{216}{LIEUT38}{哈，我感觉好多了。你呢？……现在做个听话的小人类，说出你们的避难所在哪里。这越来越无聊了。}

#{217}{}{Go to hell.}
{217}{}{去死吧。}

#{218}{}{I'll tell! Just don't hurt me anymore!}
{218}{}{我说啊！千万别再打我了！}

#{219}{}{I do so admire your will. Guards, take him back to his cell and get him ready for dipping. He'll tell us where his Vault is when he is one of us.}
{219}{}{我很钦佩你的意志。卫兵，带他回他的房间，准备浸泡他。当他成为我们的一员时，他会说出他的避难所在什么地方的。}

#{220}{}{If you're so sure I'll tell after dipping, then why all of this?}
{220}{}{浸泡以后我就会说出来吗？要是你这么有把握，那费这么多功夫干什么？}

#{221}{LIEUT39a}{Well, you see, there is this minor drawback. Sometimes, not always, a person's memory is, um . . . how shall we say, interrupted by dipping. So there is a small chance you'll forget the location.}
{221}{LIEUT39a}{唔，你知道的，还有这么一个小小的瑕疵。有时候，不是经常，一个人的记忆是，嗯……我们怎么说呢，它会被浸泡阻碍。因此有那么一丁点的可能性你会忘了那个地点。}

#{222}{}{So you can't afford to dip me.}
{222}{}{这么说你们泡不起我了。}

#{223}{}{Looks like we're both screwed.}
{223}{}{看来我们奈何不了对方了。}

#{224}{LIEUT39b}{Unfortunately, at this point, I have to take the chance. I do need that information.}
{224}{LIEUT39b}{可惜啊可惜，在这点上，我必须冒险，我太需要那个情报了。}

#{225}{}{I'll tell.}
{225}{}{我说。}

#{226}{}{You'd better hope I forget. Because if I remember any of this, your ass is mine.}
{226}{}{你最好祈祷我忘记了你对我做的事情。因为要是让我记住点什么，你的屁股准备挨揍吧。}

#{227}{LIEUT40}{Excellent. I believe you understand. So you're sure you want to tell where the Vault is? Torture can be so enjoyable.}
{227}{LIEUT40}{不错。我相信你懂了。那你确实想说那个避难所在哪里了？拷打会是十分过瘾的。}

#{228}{}{Yes, I'm sure.}
{228}{}{是的，我肯定。}

#{229}{}{Now that you mention it, no.}
{229}{}{既然这么过瘾，那我就说不了。}

#{230}{}{Can I ask you a few questions first?}
{230}{}{我能先问几个问题吗？}

#{231}{LIEUT40a}{I thought you might see it my way. No second thoughts?}
{231}{LIEUT40a}{我本来以为你会知趣的。没有别的想法吗？}

#{232}{}{I'll tell you everything.}
{232}{}{我全告诉你。}

#{233}{}{Yes, I changed my mind and I'll never tell.}
{233}{}{有啊，我改变主意了，我决不会说。}

#{234}{}{Can I ask you a few questions, first?}
{234}{}{我能先问你几个问题吗？}

#{235}{LIEUT41}{Oh, this is excellent. You know, I actually doubted my officers when they said they'd captured a prime normal. It is so nice to see you.}
{235}{LIEUT41}{哦，这太好了。你知道，当我的军官说他们抓到了一个原始的普通人时，说实话，我还不太相信。见到你真是太好了。}

#{236}{}{Go to hell.}
{236}{}{去死吧。}

#{237}{}{What do you want with me?}
{237}{}{你想把我怎么样？}

#{238}{}{Duh!}
{238}{}{咄！}

#{239}{LIEUT42}{Yes, you do have a way with words, don't you. And words are what we want, before . . .}
{239}{LIEUT42}{是的，你是巧舌如簧，不是吗。而你的消息正是我们所想要的，在……之前。}

#{240}{}{What do you mean 'before?'}
{240}{}{你说的在……之前是什么意思？}

#{241}{}{You won't get anything from me!}
{241}{}{你休想从我嘴里挖出点些什么！}

#{242}{LIEUT43}{Why, when you become one of us, of course! I can't have a perfectly good prime normal and not make it one of the Chosen Ones, now can I? After you tell me where your Vault is.}
{242}{LIEUT43}{当然是成为我们的一员了！我不能浪费一个极其完美的原始正常人，我一定要让它成为获选者，是吧？在此之前，你必须告诉我你的避难所的所在。}

#{243}{}{Tell you? You're almost funny.}
{243}{}{告诉你？你太可笑了。}

#{244}{}{On one condition.}
{244}{}{我有个条件。}

#{245}{LIEUT44}{Oh, how commendable. Enough foolishness. Where is your Vault?}
{245}{LIEUT44}{哦，真值得表扬。不要再执迷不悟了。说吧，你的避难所在哪里？}

#{246}{}{I'm not telling.}
{246}{}{我不说。}

#{247}{}{Well . . . on one condition.}
{247}{}{唔……我有个条件。}

#{248}{LIEUT45f}{Well, I'm quite impressed. My spies told me you were resourceful but they seemed to have underestimated your talents. Guards, capture her!}
{248}{LIEUT45f}{嗯，我真的很佩服你。我的间谍告诉我说，你足智多谋，不过他们看来还是低估了你的能力。卫兵，抓住她！}

#{249}{LIEUT46}{Ahh, had a nice nap? I do hope so. But now it's time to get down to business.}
{249}{LIEUT46}{啊，睡得不错啊？我希望如此。但现在是开始考虑正事的时候。}

#{250}{}{Go to hell.}
{250}{}{去死吧。}

#{251}{}{What do you want with me?}
{251}{}{你想要对我做什么？}

#{252}{LIEUT48}{The mind simply boggles at your intellect. Why the legions haven't bowed down at your feet by now, I'll never understand. Guards, take this idiot away!}
{252}{LIEUT48}{你的智商简直难以想像。我就想不通，为什么那么多人见到你都没晕倒。卫兵，把这个白痴带走！}

#{253}{LIEUT50}{As I said . . .}
{253}{LIEUT50}{正如我说的……}

#{254}{lieut51}{Like I told you before . . .}
{254}{lieut51}{正如我以前告诉你的……}

#{255}{LIEUT52}{Please listen closely this time. I said . . .}
{255}{LIEUT52}{这次请你听好了。我说……}

#{256}{lieut53}{I told you . . .}
{256}{lieut53}{我告诉你……}

#{257}{LIEUT54}{You know, you remind me of a cockroach I once owned. I crushed it because I was annoyed with its scurrying little noises. Remember that.}
{257}{LIEUT54}{你知道吗，你让我想起我以前养过的一只蟑螂，我把它碾碎了，因为它到处爬来爬去发出沙沙的响声让我厌烦。你给我记住了。}

#{258}{LIEUT55}{You're an annoying little human, aren't you? I'm not going to repeat it again.}
{258}{LIEUT55}{你是个令人讨厌的渺小人类，不是吗？我再也不会多费口舌。}

#{259}{LIEUT56}{The Unity is the goal of all Super Mutants. Through the FEV virus, we will bring all of humanity together in peace.}
{259}{LIEUT56}{“同一”是所有超级变种人的目标。借助FEV病毒，我们会实现所有人类的大团结。}

#{260}{LIEUT57}{The FEV virus was discovered by the Master many years ago. It is what makes us the Chosen Ones. But you will soon learn that, I assure you.}
{260}{LIEUT57}{FEV病毒数年前由主教发明出来。是它让我们成为获选者。但我敢保证，你很快就会认识到那点。}

#{261}{LIEUT58}{The Master is father to us all.}
{261}{LIEUT58}{主教是我们大家的创造者。}

#{262}{LIEUT59}{Nothing but a device to further our plans. No matter, all humans will be Chosen . . . or dead.}
{262}{LIEUT59}{只不过是促进我们计划的一个手段而已。无论如何，所有人要么会获选……要么死亡。}

#{263}{LIEUT60}{The Vats are where the FEV is stored, and where you normals become one of us. Of course, some die horrible, excruciatingly painful deaths, but well, those are the breaks.}
{263}{LIEUT60}{病毒槽是FEV存放的地方，也是你们正常人成为我们一员的地方。当然，一些人会死得很可怕，极其痛苦的死亡，但是，那些是个别现象。}

#{264}{LIEUT61}{They are humans who have not been exposed to radiation. They tend to fare better in the Vats than others. You are a perfect example of this.}
{264}{LIEUT61}{他们是没有暴露在辐射下的人类。他们在病毒槽中的进展比其他人会更好。你是这些人理想的样品。}

#{265}{LIEUT62}{They were constructed before the war. They are also our main source of Prime Normals.}
{265}{LIEUT62}{它们在战前建造。它们也是我们原始正常人的主要来源。}

#{266}{LIEUT63}{Morpheus. It's quite amusing. He thinks he's so much more than just a slug the Master recruited to head his Children of the Cathedral nonsense. Ah, well. He, too, will be dipped in the Vats and he'll probably die a horrible death . . . I hope.}
{266}{LIEUT63}{墨菲斯。相当滑稽。他以为自己比一条鼻滴虫强多少，不过是主教收来领导大教堂教徒那些废物的傀儡而已。啊，是的。他，也会被浸泡在病毒槽里，他或许会死得很惨……我希望如此。}

#{267}{LIEUT64}{That's not important right now.}
{267}{LIEUT64}{目前而言，这不重要。}

#{268}{LIEUT65}{That question is irrelevant to the Unity.}
{268}{LIEUT65}{那个问题与“同一”无关。}

#{269}{LIEUT66}{I won't even dignify that with an answer.}
{269}{LIEUT66}{我不屑回答。}

#{270}{LIEUT45m}{Well, I'm quite impressed. My spies told me you were resourceful, but they seemed to have underestimated your talents. Guards, capture him!}
{270}{LIEUT45m}{嗯，我真的很佩服你。我的间谍告诉我说，你足智多谋，不过他们看来还是低估了你的能力。卫兵，抓住他！}

#{271}{LIEUT39f}{Oh, I do so admire your will. Guards, take her away and prepare her for the dipping. She'll tell us where her Vault is when she is one of us.}
{271}{LIEUT39f}{哦，我很钦佩你的意志。卫兵，把她带走，准备给她浸泡。当她成为我们的一员时，她会告诉我们避难所在什么地方的。}

#{272}{LIEUT39m}{I do so admire your will. Guards, take him to his cell and prepare him for the dipping. He'll tell us where his Vault is when he is one of us.}
{272}{LIEUT39m}{我很钦佩你的意志。卫兵，带他去他的房间，准备给他浸泡。当他成为我们的一员时，他会告诉我们避难所在什么地方的。}
