{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see a weary fisherman.}
#{101}{}{Sir, I've heard about you, and I'd appreciate it if you left me and my boy in peace.}
#{102}{}{Ma'am, I've heard about you, and I'd appreciate it if you left me and my boy in peace.}
#{103}{}{Howdy sir. I don't often see strangers in this spot. Is there something I can do for you?}
#{104}{}{Howdy ma'am. I don't often see strangers in this spot. Is there something I can do for you?}
#{105}{}{You wouldn't happen to know where I could find a water chip, would you?}
#{106}{}{You wouldn't know anything about mutant armies, would you?}
#{107}{}{Where do you come from?}
#{108}{}{How's the fishing?}
#{109}{}{Give me everything you've got or I'll kill you!}
#{110}{}{Runk!}
#{111}{}{Wait a minute, aren't you that fella who wanders the wastes and kicks the monsters' butts? Can I help you?}
#{112}{}{What a minute, aren't you that filly who wanders the wastes and kicks the monsters' butts? Can I help you?}
#{113}{}{I'm running a little low on supplies . . .}
#{114}{}{No man's ever called me inhospitable, and I don't want to repeat what women call me, but I am trying to fish and I need absolute quiet to catch the damn things, so please try to keep quiet.}
#{115}{}{Has anyone ever told you that you ramble on?}
#{116}{}{Okay.}
{100}{}{你看到一个疲倦的渔民.}
{101}{}{先生，我听说过你，如果你能让我和我儿子安静的待着，我会感激你的。}
{102}{}{小姐，我听说过你，如果你能让我和我儿子安静的待着，我会感激你的。}
{103}{}{你好先生。我在这并不经常见到陌生人。我能为你做点什么吗？}
{104}{}{你好小姐。我在这并不经常见到陌生人。我能为你做点什么吗？}
{105}{}{你不知道在哪里能找到净水芯片吗？}
{106}{}{你不知道关于变种军队的事情吗？}
{107}{}{你从哪来的？}
{108}{}{钓多少了？}
{109}{}{把你所有的东西都给我，不然我杀了你！}
{110}{}{垃圾！}
{111}{}{等会，你不是那个在废土里徘徊胖揍怪物的小伙子吗？我能帮你吗？}
{112}{}{等会，你不是那个在废土里徘徊胖揍怪物的小姑娘吗？我能帮你吗？}
{113}{}{我吃用都有点紧……}
{114}{}{从没有人说我待人冷漠，我也不想重复那些婆娘说我什么。但是我在抓鱼，而且我只有绝对的安静才能逮到它们，所以请你保持安静。}
{115}{}{没人告诉过你你很唠叨？}
{116}{}{好。}
#{117}{}{I'm looking for information.}
#{118}{}{Do I look like a scavenger to you? Well, maybe I do, but that's because I spend a lot of time in the Wastes trying to teach my boy to fish and be a man.}
#{119}{}{I haven't done any scavenging in six years. Too many Rad Scorpions. A fella could get killed out there with all them varmints running around.}
#{120}{}{About eight years ago, I sold some chips in Junktown. I don't know what they did. One of them could have been a water chip, though I wouldn't bet on it.}
#{121}{}{Anyhow, I need quiet for my fishing, so I'd appreciate it if you'd keep quiet and let me get back to work before me and my boy starve.}
#{122}{}{Mutant armies? Not in this spot. Just regular armies would be bad enough, heh heh.}
#{123}{}{You know there's too much politics in the world. I keep telling my boy that these politicians can't wait to blow up the world again. That's why I'm living off the land, to avoid the politicians! Only way to live.}
#{124}{}{Now that's rather personal information there. I've killed men for asking less, just ask the boy. But I think you look like an honest person, so I'll let it slide this time.}
#{125}{}{Well, I've fished this place for the last five years and it keeps getting worse and worse. I think it's Skunk, the three-eyed giant catfish, that keeps scaring everything away from my spot.}
#{126}{}{But I'm gonna get that fish, just you wait. It's getting personal between us, and only one of us is gonna walk away, believe me. I'm more serious than the Brotherhood of Steel about this.}
#{127}{}{Now you'll probably kill me, but if I don't stand up to you, I'll be setting a bad example for the boy. See my dilemma? Why don't you just walk away and make it easier for both of us!}
#{128}{}{I'm not walking away, and you won't be walking at all unless you do what I say.}
#{129}{}{Shut up and die!}
#{130}{}{Fine. I'll leave you in peace.}
#{131}{}{Son, I think you've been wandering the wastes a little too long.}
#{132}{}{Miss, I think you've been wandering the wastes a little too long.}
#{133}{}{Try some of this.}
{117}{}{我要打听点消息。}
{118}{}{在你眼里我就像个扫大街的？也对，也许我就是。但那是因为我把许多时间都花在教我的儿子怎么在废土捕鱼，怎么在废土做人上了。}
{119}{}{我花了六年也没把这里清理干净。辐射蝎太多了。也许要个棒小伙子才能把这群杂碎全杀光。}
{120}{}{大约8年以前，我在迦克镇卖了一些芯片。我不知道它们是做什么用的。不过其中好象有净水芯片，不过我不能确定。}
{121}{}{总之，我抓鱼要安静，所以如果你保持安静我会很感激你。我要继续干活才能不让我和我儿子挨饿。}
{122}{}{变种人军团？这没有那玩意吧。不变种的军团已经够坏了。呵呵。}
{123}{}{你知道这世界上有太多的搞政治的，我不断告诉我的孩子那些政客迫不及待的要把世界再炸一回。所以我靠土地吃饭就是要躲开那帮人！这是生存唯一的办法。}
{124}{}{现在我们聊点私人的事情。我曾经为了让人闭嘴就杀过人。哪怕是问那孩子，但我觉的你是个诚实的人，所以我现在把这件事撇一边去。}
{125}{}{我在这钓了5年的鱼，最近鱼越来越少。我认为都是那些臭鼬, 还有那条三只眼的大鲶鱼，把我地盘上所有的东西都赶走了。}
{126}{}{我这就去钓它，你等着。这是我们之间私人恩怨，不是它死就是我亡，相信我，对这个我比钢铁兄弟会还认真。}
{127}{}{现在你可以杀我了，但是如果我不反抗你的话，就会给我孩子做个坏榜样。看到我难处了吗？为什么你不走开让我们都轻松些呢。}
{128}{}{我不会走开，你也不准走开，除非你按我说的做。}
{129}{}{闭嘴，死把！}
{130}{}{很好。我会安静的离开你的。}
{131}{}{孩子，我认为你在废土里晃悠的时间太长了。}
{132}{}{小姐，我认为你在废土里晃悠的时间太长了。}
{133}{}{试试这个。}

#{134}{}{Try some of . . . oh damn, where did I put it . . .}
#{135}{}{Well, I heard about a big Vault way to the East, and reports of a secret Vault somewhere down south. And there may be some chips in Junktown and the Hub. Hope that helps.}
#{136}{}{I hate to be inhospitable, but I need quiet for my fishing, so I'd appreciate it if you'd keep quiet and let me get back to work before me and my boy starve. And good luck killing those varmints.}
#{137}{}{Mutant armies? Just plain armies would be bad enough. I heard tell that someone's been harassing the ghouls over in Necropolis, but that was a while ago.}
#{138}{}{Now that's a personal question. My mother's womb, of course, but that's a little too flip. I don't have a home no more. Me and my boy just wander and try to survive.}
#{139}{}{I do know where some caches are stored, but that's my secret.}
#{140}{}{Well, it's kill or be killed - the Law of the Wastes - out here, but I'll tell you what. You keep killing monsters and I'll give you some supplies.}
#{141}{}{Yeah you are. But what the hell does 'runk' mean? Whatever it is, I hope it's friendly.}
#{142}{}{Now I'm hurt. Here I go, out of my way to be neighborly, and you accuse me of rambling! Well! I don't offend easy, but you just gone and made me mad enough to nuke someone.}
#{143}{}{Anyhow, why don't you just get outta here. Git!}
#{144}{}{Thank you kindly.}
#{145}{}{What do you want to talk about?}
#{146}{}{I'm trying to find a water chip.}
#{147}{}{I'm trying to find out about some mutant armies.}
#{148}{}{What can you tell me about the Brotherhood?}
#{149}{}{What can you tell me about the Boneyard?}
#{150}{}{I'm sorry friend, I don't think I can help you.}

{134}{}{试……试这……噢！该死，我把它放哪了……}
{135}{}{好，我听说东面有个大避难所，里面有个秘密的文件说在南方有个秘密避难所。迦克镇和哈勃城可能有净水芯片。希望对你有用。}
{136}{}{我不喜欢冷漠的态度，但是我钓鱼需要安静。所以如果你在我和我儿子饿死之前让我回去干活，我会很感激你。祝你杀那些怪物的时候好运。}
{137}{}{变种军团？平原里的军队就够坏的了。我听说就在不久前他们中的一些人不断袭击大墓地里的僵尸。}
{138}{}{现在是个私人问题。H他妈拢对不起，失礼了。我已经无家可归了，我和我儿子到处流浪努力活下去。}
{139}{}{我知道哪里藏着存储，但那是我的秘密。}
{140}{}{好把，不是杀人就是被杀―这就是废土的法律―但是我要对你说的是，你继续杀那些怪物的话，我就给你补给。}
{141}{}{呀，是你。你他妈知道“垃圾”是什么意思吗？管它是什么，我只希望它是友好的。}
{142}{}{我生气了。我象个朋友那样来了，你却骂我乱逛！我不轻易得罪人，但这你逼我的！}
{143}{}{你怎么还不离开这？饭桶！}
{144}{}{谢谢。}
{145}{}{你想说什么？}
{146}{}{我正在找净水芯片。}
{147}{}{我正在搜寻变种人军团的线索。}
{148}{}{你能告诉我关于钢铁兄弟会的事情吗？}
{149}{}{你能告诉我关于晒骨场的事情吗？}
{150}{}{对不起朋友，我想我帮不了你。}
#{151}{}{'Runk' ain't the same as keeping quiet. Now shut yer yap and get outta here.}
#{152}{}{Fine. Take what you want and get out.}
#{153}{}{You really aren't very friendly, are you?}
#{154}{}{You'll forgive me if I ain't more appreciative, but I think you should just leave.}
#{155}{}{I try to avoid them if I can. Their patrols can be pretty nasty if they decide not to take a liking to you.}
#{156}{}{That's down on the coast. I hear stories about gangs running amok and all sorts of things that I don't want the boy to see, so I'm staying away from that place!}
#{157}{}{Now put that thing away before you hurt someone. A man can't have a civil conversation when there are weapons drawn.}
#{158}{}{Son, there's nothing like a battle between a fish and a man.}
#{159}{}{Son, did I ever tell you about the time I caught the giant eel . . .}
#{160}{}{Son, don't talk back to your father!}
#{161}{}{Maybe this time I'll catch that three-eyed catfish.}
#{162}{}{Dinner's coming right up!}
#{163}{}{There's nothing like the taste of a juicy fish on an open fire.}
#{164}{}{Quiet son, you're scaring away the fish.}
{151}{}{“垃圾” 就是非常的吵！现在你给我闭嘴，滚！}
{152}{}{非常好，拿去你想要的，走吧。}
{153}{}{你真太不友好了！我很生气，后果很严重。}
{154}{}{原谅我吧，我确实没眼力劲，但是我还是认为你应该离开。}
{155}{}{我尽量躲他们远点，一旦他们的巡逻队决定盯上你，你就没什么出头之日了。}
{156}{}{在沿海，我听说有一群杀人狂无法无天无恶不作，我可不想让我儿子碰到，所以我要搬家！}
{157}{}{在你伤害什么人之前快收拾东西走吧。人不会在武力威胁下平静交谈的！}
{158}{}{儿子，世上没有像人和鱼这样的战争！}
{159}{}{儿子，你还记得我捕的那条大鳗鱼吗……}
{160}{}{儿子，别和你爸我顶嘴！}
{161}{}{也许这回我能捉到那只三只眼的鲶鱼。}
{162}{}{晚餐有着落了！}
{163}{}{世上没有比鲜嫩的鱼更美味的东西了。}
{164}{}{安静儿子，你把鱼吓跑了。}
