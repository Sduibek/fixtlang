#{102}{}{I said to talk to my dad if you want a job, not me.}
{102}{}{我说过了，找工作的话去和我爸爸说，别烦我。}

#{103}{}{So, that old bastard gave you the okay to work for us, eh?  Well you must be one tough bitch.
# I'm impressed, but we'll see how you do.  We leave only twice a month, on

{103}{}{老不死的居然同意你来干活了？你他妈一定是个悍妇。我很欣赏，但要看你的表现了。我们每个月出发两次，3号和17号，你能来吧。我们主要去四个地方：钢铁兄弟会、迦克镇、大墓地和晒骨场。}

#{105}{}{And the pay?}
{105}{}{报酬如何？}

#{106}{}{Uh.}
{106}{}{呜。}

#{107}{}{Our pay's the best, 600 scripts, and yes, that is for each way?but you don't have to do both.  This

# sissies on my caravans and you better have plenty of ammo.}
{107}{}{我们的薪水最高。600个瓶盖，没错，单程600个瓶盖。不过，你也不必来回都跟着。商队的旅行是很危险的，肯定会遇见强盗的或者更可怕的东西。我们的队伍里没有胆小鬼，你最好带足弹药。}

#{156}{}{Good. Like I said before we pay 600 scripts. Which route did you want to take?}
{156}{}{很好，我们说好了600个瓶盖。你想走哪条路线？}

#{157}{}{Cool.  The next one's going out on }

#{181}{}{That town's full of skags!  Well, I better get you going.}
{181}{}{城里全是嗑药仔！嗯，你还是准备动身吧。}

#{182}{}{LA's pretty cool.  You'll like it, but just be sure not to leave the caravan until it arrives.  It's
# not to safe, for the caravans that is.}
{182}{}{洛杉矶，很酷的地方。最好不要离开商队，那里不太安全。}

{196}{}{哦？那你现在就去忙那些破事啊！你已经不在我们考虑的人选名单里了。}

#{197}{}{What?  You've never worked a caravan before?  I can't believe my dad hired you in the first place!
# Get lost!  We only hire experienced personnel!  That's why we pay the big bucks!}
{197}{}{你以前没干过保镖？我没想到阿爸居然还是你的第一任主顾呢！我们只要有经验的保镖！所以我们开的工资很高！}
