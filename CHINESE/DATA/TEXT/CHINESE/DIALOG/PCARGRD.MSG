#{100}{}{You see a Paladin.}
#{101}{}{Pssst, see any good deals?}
#{102}{}{Sorry, I'm on duty. Can't talk right now.}
#{103}{}{What a nice day. I hope we don't have any attacks today.}
#{104}{}{Good day.}
#{105}{}{Some of these Caravan traders are a little strange.}
#{106}{}{Hi there good looking.}
#{107}{}{Greetings initiate.}
#{108}{}{If you have any questions about our order you should talk to Cabbot
#over by the door.}
#{109}{}{Cabbot is the one you want to talk to, he's the young lad by the door.}
#{110}{}{If you're here to trade you're talking to the wrong person.}
#{111}{}{What?}
#{112}{}{Don't bother me worm.}
#{113}{}{Do I look like I'm interested in anything you might have to offer.}
#{114}{}{Hmph. The nerve.}
#{115}{}{I'm on watch, don't disturb me.}
#{116}{}{Initiate, you should know better than to bother us while we're on watch.}
#{117}{}{Initiate, shouldn't you be doing something useful.}
#{118}{}{If you have any questions about our order you should talk to Cabbot
#over by the door.}
#{119}{}{I don't think you should be here stranger.}

{109}{}{你是来找卡波特的吧，门口那个年轻人就是。}
{110}{}{如果你打算交易那你找错人了。}
{111}{}{什么？}
{112}{}{不要搔扰我，可怜虫。}
{113}{}{你认为我会对你的那点东西感兴趣吗？}
{114}{}{咳，神经。}
{115}{}{我在值班，不要搔扰我。}
{116}{}{新兵，你应该知道在我们忙着的时候不喜欢被打扰。}
