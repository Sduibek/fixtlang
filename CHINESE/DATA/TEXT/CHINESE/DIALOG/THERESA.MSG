#{100}{}{You see Theresa.}
{100}{}{你看见了特蕾莎。}

#{101}{}{Hello, }
{101}{}{你好，}

#{102}{}{. How fares your journey?}
{102}{}{。你的旅程进展如何？}

#{103}{}{It's going pretty well, thanks.}
{103}{}{还不错，谢谢。}

#{104}{}{Not very well.}
{104}{}{不是很顺利。}

#{105}{}{Hoogh!}
{105}{}{唉！}

#{106}{}{It's good to hear that. I knew that the outside world couldn't be as bad as everyone says. I mean, our ancestors lived outside, right? But that paranoid Overseer won't let us leave.}
{106}{}{很高兴听到是这样。我就知道外面的世界不会像所有人说的那样糟。我的意思是说，我们的祖先生活在外面，对吧？但是那个妄想狂所长不会让我们离开的。}

#{107}{}{The Overseer probably has his reasons.}
{107}{}{所长或许有他的理由。}

#{108}{}{Actually, it's pretty bad out there.}
{108}{}{事实上，外面确实很糟。}

#{109}{}{You're right; the outside world isn't all that bad.}
{109}{}{你是对的，外面的世界不全是那么糟。}

#{110}{}{The Overseer is simply trying to protect us. The outside world is dangerous to the unprepared.}
{110}{}{所长只是想保护我们而已。外面的世界对没有准备的人来说是危险的。}

#{111}{}{Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that you're able to find the chip soon.}
{111}{}{哦，听到这些我很遗憾。我希望不久之后你就能找到芯片。}

#{112}{}{Shouldn't be a problem.}
{112}{}{不会是什么问题。}

#{113}{}{With all of the hazards I've been running in to, it may take some time.}
{113}{}{从我曾卷入的各种危险来看，这可能会需要点时间。}

#{114}{}{Hmm. I suppose it was too much to hope that the outside world had taught you to communicate. Oh well.}
{114}{}{蕖Ｎ蚁氩挥Ω眉南Ｍ于外面的世界教你沟通。哦好吧。}

#{115}{}{And I suppose he chose you to go outside because he knew that you were under his thumb! He really just doesn't want to give up his control over us.}
{115}{}{而我想他选择了你出去是因为他知道你在他的手掌心里！他确实不愿意放弃对我们的控制。}

#{116}{}{I resent that remark!}
{116}{}{我恨这句话！}

#{117}{}{Actually, I think he believes that there's no reason to risk survival outside while it's still safe in here.}
{117}{}{事实上，我认为他相信在这里还安全的时候没有必要让幸存者出去冒险。}

#{118}{}{Hmm. From what I've read, the outside isn't really all that dangerous. But I suppose that you would know better than I, wouldn't you?}
{118}{}{呵呵。从我读到过的看来，外面并不真的是全然危险的，但是我想你比我更了解，不是吗？}

#{119}{}{I knew that the outside couldn't be too bad. That's why I've been trying to convince some people to come outside with me. I think that we have a better chance of survival out there.}
{119}{}{我知道外面还不算非常糟，这就是为什么我劝说一些人和我一起出去的原因。我想我们在外面生存的可能性更大。}

#{120}{}{What are you smoking!?}
{120}{}{你在抽什么！？}

#{121}{}{That's probably a good idea.}
{121}{}{这或许是个好主意。}

#{122}{}{I suppose. I always figured that he just had some sort of power trip. But I guess that he wouldn't be the Overseer if he wasn't really concerned about our welfare, would he? I guess we should just wait and see if you can find the chip.}
{122}{}{我总是认为他只是有些权力欲过剩。但是我猜如果他不真正关心我们的利益，就不会是所长，不是吗？我觉得我们应该稍等，看看你能不能找到芯片。}

#{123}{}{Don't worry, I'll take care of it.}
{123}{}{别担心，我会处理的。}

#{124}{}{Oh, come on! Wake up! If he thinks the outside is so dangerous, then how come he sent you out there? The man just has a control complex. You're a stupid tool and you don't even know it!}
{124}{}{哦，快点！醒醒吧！如果他认为外面如此危险的话，那他为什么他把你派出去？这人只是有一种控制欲而已。你只是个没有思想的工具，你自己甚至都没有注意到！}

#{125}{}{Honestly, if he thought that the outside was that dangerous, he'd have sent a whole team with weapons and equipment, not just you. But you're his pawn, since he doesn't want anyone to realize what they're missing.}
{125}{}{说实话，如果他认为外面那么危险的话，他应该派出一整支武装齐全的小队，而不只是你一个人。但你是他的卒子，因为他不想让任何人知道他们遗漏了什么。}

#{126}{}{Oh, get real! Do you really think that we can live in this Vault generation after generation? Maybe you can find a new chip, but what happens when the next thing breaks down? And the next?}
{126}{}{哦，回到现实中来吧！你真的认为我们能一代又一代的活在这个避难所里吗？或许你能找到一块新的芯片，可如果这块又坏了怎么办？再下一块又坏了怎么办？}

#{127}{}{Huh. I guess you're right.}
{127}{}{呼。我想你可能是对的。}

#{128}{}{Maybe we can't stay here forever. But rushing out into the world without preparation and without the consent of the group isn't the answer.}
{128}{}{或许我们不能永远呆在这里。但是不做准备又没有集体的支持就冲到外面的世界去并不是个好主意。}

#{129}{}{A lot of us think so. That's why we're planning to take some supplies and head out in a few days. Say, do you have any advice for us?}
{129}{}{我们很多人是这么想的。这就是为什么我们正在计划搞些补给，准备出去几天看看，你能给我们出些主意吗？}

#{130}{}{Sorry, I haven't really found much out there.}
{130}{}{抱歉，我并没有在外面找到什么。}

#{131}{}{You could head to this little village called Shady Sands, a few days east. They might help.}
{131}{}{你可以到一个叫做沙荫镇的村庄去看看，向东几天路程。他们说不定会有所帮助。}

#{132}{}{Okay. Well, thanks.}
{132}{}{行。好的，谢谢了。}

#{133}{}{Oh, just go away! We don't need the help of one of the Overseer's pawns!}
{133}{}{哦，快走开吧！我们不需要所长爪牙的帮助！}

#{134}{}{Welcome to our meeting! As you have been picked by the Overseer to go outside, perhaps you can give us some advice before our move to the outdoors as well.}
{134}{}{欢迎来参加我们的会议！既然你已经被所长选中外出，那么或许在我们出门之前，你最好能够给我们一些建议。}

#{135}{}{Don't drink glowing water.}
{135}{}{别喝发光发热的水。}

#{136}{}{Yeah . . . don't go.}
{136}{}{是的……别出去。}

#{137}{}{I think that your plans to leave are ill-advised.}
{137}{}{我觉得你那离开的计划不是个好主意。}

#{138}{}{Hoooot!}
{138}{}{好烫！}

#{139}{}{Thank you so much. I can see you're going to be a big help. Why don't you just leave?}
{139}{}{真是太感谢你了。我能预见到你会是个“有力”的帮手。你为什么不快点滚开呢？}

#{140}{}{Sorry, I'm here to hear all of this.}
{140}{}{抱歉，我在这里听到了所有的东西。}

#{141}{}{Fine then.}
{141}{}{那么好吧。}

#{142}{}{Really? Considering our position, our lack of water, and the original purpose of this Vault, why do you think that we should stay?}
{142}{}{真的？考虑到我们的情况，净水的缺乏以及这避难所最初修建的目的，你觉得我们有什么理由留在这里？}

#{143}{}{It's just a bad idea, is all.}
{143}{}{这是个坏主意，完全的坏主意。}

#{144}{}{The outside world is too dangerous to the unprepared. It's best to have time to make proper preparations before going. The Overseer is trying to give the Vault that needed time.}
{144}{}{外面的世界对于全无准备的人来说太过危险。在出发之前最好做好合适的准备。所长就是在试着给避难所的人们所需要的时间。}

#{145}{}{Well, considering that you have some experience with the outside, perhaps you have some valuable points to make.}
{145}{}{好吧，考虑到你对外面的世界有所了解，或许你的观点是有价值的。}

#{146}{}{The outside is too dangerous and hostile. You wouldn't last long.}
{146}{}{外面的世界充满敌意和危险。你们活不了多长时间。}

#{147}{}{I just need a little more time to find the water chip.}
{147}{}{我只要再多一点时间就能找到净水芯片了。}

#{148}{}{If you can't give us good reasons why we shouldn't leave, then we're not going to wait here and die of water poisoning. Please don't get in our way.}
{148}{}{如果你给不出不让我们离开的好理由，那我们再也不会在这里坐等有毒废水弄死自己了。请别挡着我们的路。}

#{149}{}{Sorry, folks, I can't let you do this.}
{149}{}{抱歉，各位，我不能让你们这么做。}

#{150}{}{Very well. It's your choice.}
{150}{}{很好。这是你的选择。}

#{151}{}{It's only a matter of time before we run out of water here. But the Vault was never meant to keep people inside forever! We have the people and the supplies to move outside now. We have a better chance.}
{151}{}{我们停水只不过是时间问题了。而避难所并不意味着让里面的居民永远停留其中！我们现在有人员和给养转移到外界。我们的有更好的生存机会。}

#{152}{}{Outside is too dangerous.}
{152}{}{外面太危险了。}

#{153}{}{The Vault was made to release its inhabitants together as a group, not as a small band that will be quickly overwhelmed.}
{153}{}{建造避难所是为了让它的居民成为社群，而不是一个很快会消亡的小团体。}

#{154}{}{Hmm. Perhaps you're right. There are probably other survivors out there, and they could be hostile, too. I guess we will need to wait for everyone else to be ready.}
{154}{}{蕖？赡苣闶嵌缘摹Ｍ饷婊蛐砘褂衅渌的幸存者，他们也有可能是敌对的。我想我们需要等到其他人都准备好。}

#{155}{}{We're well-prepared now. We have equipment and simulator training. A few hazards outside are better than dying slowly of thirst!}
{155}{}{我们现在已经准备得很充分了。我们有装备，进行了模拟训练。外面的危险总比慢慢渴死的好！}

#{156}{}{Sorry, I can't let you leave now.}
{156}{}{抱歉，我现在不能让你离开。}

#{157}{}{Well, good luck then.}
{157}{}{好吧，那么祝好运。}

#{158}{}{I don't like it, but I suppose we will wait until everyone is ready to leave together.}
{158}{}{我并不喜欢这样，但是我想我们会等待，直到所有人都一起离开。}

#{159}{}{It's for the best. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.}
{159}{}{那样最好。相信我，我知道我在说什么。}

#{160}{}{Thank you all for coming again.}
{160}{}{无论如何，谢谢你再次过来。}

#{161}{}{Our plans are moving forward still.}
{161}{}{我们的计划仍在进行中。}

#{162}{}{We are gathering more converts every week.}
{162}{}{每个礼拜都有更多人加入我们。}

#{163}{}{Soon, we will have access to the gear we need.}
{163}{}{很快，我们就能够使用我们需要的装备了。}

#{164}{}{The water chip still has not been found. We must move soon.}
{164}{}{净水芯片还没有找到。我们必须快点行动。}

#{165}{}{The Overseer cannot oppose such a large group.}
{165}{}{所长不能对抗那么大的群体。}

#{166}{}{Be patient. We will only need to wait a few more weeks.}
{166}{}{耐心点。我们只需要再等上几个星期。}

#{167}{}{Then, we will at last be free of the Vault and the Overseer.}
{167}{}{然后，我们最终就能够摆脱避难所和所长了。}

#{168}{}{Remember to practice your outdoor skills in the simulators!}
{168}{}{记得在模拟器中练习你们的野外技能！}

#{169}{}{Be well, everyone.}
{169}{}{各位，祝好运。}

#{170}{}{Please hurry and find the water chip. We cannot wait much longer.}
{170}{}{请尽快找到净水芯片。我们不能再等了。}

#{171}{}{Don't worry, I will.}
{171}{}{别担心，我会的。}

#{172}{}{I didn't think you would succeed, but you did a good job. Thank you for saving us all.}
{172}{}{我原先不认为你会成功，但你确实干的不错。谢谢你救了我们所有人。}

#{173}{}{You gain 750 experience points for peacefully calming the Vault's revolutionary faction.}
{173}{}{由于和平说服了避难所的革命派系，你获得了750经验值。}

#{174}{}{Traitor! Why did you ever come back here? Now everybody will die!}
{174}{}{叛徒！你怎么还有脸回到这里！现在所有人都要死了！}

#{175}{}{We've been over this before. Leave us alone.}
{175}{}{我们以前遇到过这样的情况。让我们自己解决吧。}

{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{我可以告诉你：Chip-芯片、Vault-避难所、War-大战、Outside-外面的世界、Overseer-所长、Water-水、Waterchip-净水芯片。}
