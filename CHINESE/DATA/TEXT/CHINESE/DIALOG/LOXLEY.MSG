#{101}{LOX_0}{It's a little gift from me Da and Mum.  Actually, a few generations before that.  Do you like it?}
{101}{LOX_0}{这是我爸妈留给我的小礼物。其实是更上一代人留下的。你觉得怎么样？}

#{102}{}{It suits you.}
{102}{}{很适合你。}

#{103}{}{No, it hurts my ears.}
{103}{}{不，它很刺耳。}

#{104}{LOX_0A}{Why, thank you.  Have to work a bit to keep it with so little refinement about, don't you know.  But enough of that. Loxley's the name.  And yours is?}
{104}{LOX_0A}{哎呀，谢谢你。装斯文真累，对吧？好，言归正传，我叫洛克西里。你是？}

#{105}{}{I'm }

#{108}{}{What is this place?}
{108}{}{这是什么地方？}

#{110}{LOX_1F}{Bloody impressive making it through the defenses like that!  What's your name, luv?}
{110}{LOX_1F}{你这样通过外面的防御，真他妈的帅呆了！宝贝儿，你叫什么？}

#{109}{LOX_1M}{Bloody fine job making it through the defenses, mate!  I'm rather impressed.  Toss me your name!}

# TRANSLATION NOTE: The following line is the player addressing Loxley (who is male).
#{115}{}{You got a real interesting accent, my friend.}
{115}{}{朋友，你的口音可真有特点。}


#{116}{}{You talk like an idiot.}
{116}{}{你讲话像个白痴。}

#{117}{}{Nuhhh?}
{117}{}{啊哈？}

#{118}{LOX_2F}{Quite pleased to make your acquaintance actually...for now.  Let's get the other bit of politeness taken care of, shall we?  What the bloody, bloody, bloody hell are you doing here!}
{118}{LOX_2F}{很高兴认识你，起码……目前为止是。让我们换另外一个客套话题如何？我日，日，日啊，你他妈的来这干吗？}

#{119}{}{I want to join the Circle.}
{119}{}{我想加入工会。}

#{120}{}{I need to ask you a few things.}
{120}{}{我得问你点事儿。}

#{121}{}{I'm taking you all off to jail.}
{121}{}{我要把你们统统送班房去！}

#{122}{LOX_3}{Oh, how nice.  A joiner.  Well, you've worked hard enough for a look-see.  But if you really want to join, then you'll have to take the Second Test.}
{122}{LOX_3}{喔，好极了。一个入伙的。呃，你初试完成的不错。但是如果你真的想加入，你还得再完成复试。}

#{123}{}{What's that?}
{123}{}{什么复试？}

#{124}{}{Sounds scary . . . How about I pass?}
{124}{}{听起来很难……你就让我直接通过得了。}

#{125}{}{Uh . . . what was the first test?}
{125}{}{那个……第一个测试是什么来着？}

#{126}{LOX_4}{Quite simple, really.  You prove yourself as a thief.  Succeed, and the world is yours!  If not, then you'll never see us again.  Except if you come looking.  And if you don't understand, that last bit is a threat.}
{126}{LOX_4}{很简单，真的。你证明自己是个盗贼。成功后，你将成为行会的一员！否则，你将永远不会见到我们了。除非你不明白最后一句是个警告而再次回来。}

#{127}{}{What's the test?}
{127}{}{测试内容是什么？}

#{128}{}{Do you mean you'll move this whole place if I fail, or try to kill me.}
{128}{}{你的意思是如果我搞砸了你要么脑袋搬家，要么准备宰了我。}

#{129}{}{Are you threatening me?}
{129}{}{你在威胁我吗？}

#{130}{LOX_5}{It's so, so simple.  In the Heights you'll find Daren Hightower's home all plump and ripe for the picking.  Are you ready for life!  Do you accept the challenge?}
{130}{LOX_5}{它非常，非常的简单。在富人区，你可以找到达伦・海托的家，那里满是值钱的东西可以拿。做好冒险的准备了吗？接受这个挑战吗？}

#{131}{}{I'm ready!}
{131}{}{我准备好了!}

#{132}{}{Hell, no!}
{132}{}{去他妈的，我不去！}

#{134}{LOX_6F}{That's the spirit, luv!}
{134}{LOX_6F}{就得要这种精气神啊，甜心！}

#{133}{LOX_6M}{That's the spirit, mate!}
{133}{LOX_6M}{就得要这种精气神啊，兄弟！}

#{135}{LOX_6B}{Just talk to Jasmine in the room outside this chamber.  She'll give you details, a map, and a few little goodies to help you on your way.  But remember, if you even think about ratting us out to the cops, we'll be a memory before they arriv#e.  But enough gloom.  Cheerio, good luck, and ta-ta!}
{135}{LOX_6B}{去问外屋的茉莉就行了。她会告诉你细节，给你一张地图和一些帮你完成任务的工具。不过记着，如果你狗胆包天把我们出卖给条子，我们在他们到之前就会消失得无影无踪。不说丧气话了，精神点！祝你好运，回头见！}

#{136}{LOX_7}{Well, then why the bloody hell are you here?  Sightseeing?  The ambiance?  My handsome face?}
{136}{LOX_7}{呃，那你他妈的在这搞什么？来这里观光旅游？感受这里的温馨格调？还是因为我长得帅而慕名而来？}

#{137}{}{No, I came to ask you a few questions.}
{137}{}{不，我来问你几个问题。}

#{138}{}{Certainly not the face.}
{138}{}{显然不是因为你长得帅。}

#{139}{}{You're right, I'd like to join the Circle.}
{139}{}{你说对了，我想加入工会。}

#{140}{LOX_8}{That's it?  A few questions!  Well, you're either incredibly brave or a total moron.  Ask away, ask away!...and then we'll show you to the door, shall we?}
{140}{LOX_8}{就为了这？几个问题！好吧，你要么是吃了豹子胆要么就是个十足的傻逼。问吧，问吧！……问完了我们欢送你出门，如何？}

#{141}{LOX_9}{You must be joking!  You think I'd fall for a line like that!  Get out, you commoner!}
{141}{LOX_9}{别扯蛋了！你认为我会相信那种鬼话吗！滚出去，你个土老冒！}

#{142}{LOX_10}{Oh, quite the little attitude!  But, we're all friends here, aren't we?}
{142}{LOX_10}{啊，很有个性！不过，我们现在都是朋友，不是吗？}

#{143}{}{I don't see why.}
{143}{}{我没觉得。}

#{144}{}{Your're right. I'm sorry.}
{144}{}{你是对的。不好意思。}

#{145}{LOX_11}{Ohhh, broken heart.  Our chance for camaraderie lost. [Sigh] Jasmine, show this little sod the door.}
{145}{LOX_11}{哦，让人伤心。我们建立友情的机会没了。【叹气】茉莉，送这个老土出去。}

#{146}{LOX_12}{Ooh, a little back and forth.  I like someone who plays the edge.  I think you'll be a great addition to our merry little band.  What say you?}
{146}{LOX_12}{呵，来来去去，我喜欢有激情的人。我觉得你会让我们欢乐的小家庭如虎添翼，想入伙吗？}

#{147}{}{Okay!}
{147}{}{当然！}

#{148}{}{I say you're a total lunatic.}
{148}{}{我想你脑子进水了。}

#{149}{lox_12b}{Okay!}
{149}{lox_12b}{好！}

#{150}{LOX_13}{Oh, bosh and bother.  Well, quite sorry to hear that, actually.  You would've made a fine thief.  But the Circle's not for the terminally stupid.  So, Jasmine, show our guest the door, please.}
{150}{LOX_13}{唉，稀泥糊不上墙。你的话真的很让人失望。你本来可以成为一个优秀的盗贼的，但本质上，你还是那种脑袋不开窍的人，进不来行会的。所以，茉莉，送客。}

#{151}{LOX_14}{Oh, what do you take me for?  If you want cold blooded murder, talk to Decker and his lot.  If you fail, which seems much more likely at this point, we will simple disappear.  Now, then care to try or not?}
{151}{LOX_14}{哦，你把我当成什么人了？如果你装酷做冷血杀手，去找德克和他手下的那帮子家伙玩。我的意思是，如果你搞砸了－－目前而言，我觉得你是不太容易成功的－－我们直接闪人就是了。好了，你到底要不要接受复试？}

#{152}{}{Sure.}
{152}{}{当然。}

#{153}{}{Not.}
{153}{}{不。}

#{154}{LOX_16}{Oh, no.  I'm so afraid.  Life is so hard. Loxley, I'd rather be a coward for all of my life than to have a single moment of triumph.  Ah, just another wanker, aren't you.  Out!}
{154}{LOX_16}{啊～不啊～我怕怕～活着不容易啊，洛克西里，我宁愿做一辈子胆小鬼也不愿意出一时的风头。哈，你不就是这种小人吗？滚！}

#{155}{LOX_17}{Haven't figured it out yet, have we?  The First Test was just getting here!  That's the only reason I'm considering you.}
{155}{LOX_17}{还没弄明白，啊？初试就是到达这里！所以我才给你入会的机会。}

#{156}{}{Okay, I'll do whatever you want!!}
{156}{}{没问题，你让我干什么我就干什么！}

#{157}{}{What's the next test?}
{157}{}{下个测试是什么？}

#{158}{}{Well, all I need to do is ask you a few questions.}
{158}{}{唔，我唯一要做的就是问你几个问题。}

#{159}{LOX_18}{Ha ha ha.  Ooh, that's quite amusing.  Take us to jail, will you?  And how, may I ask, do you plan this feat?}
{159}{LOX_18}{哈哈哈。哇，太叫人吃惊了。送我们进监狱，就凭你？我可以问一下，你打算怎么完成这个伟大壮举的呢？}

#{160}{}{Just come along quietly and no one will get hurt.}
{160}{}{你们老老实实的跟我走就没人会受伤。}

#{161}{}{Well, maybe I'll let you off this time.}
{161}{}{好，或许这次我可以放你一马。}

#{162}{LOX_21}{What's it to me?  It's simple, really.  Tell me your name, or we show you the door.}
{162}{LOX_21}{关我什么事？这很简单，真的。报上你的名字，否则我们送你出门。}

#{163}{}{Okay. I'm }
{163}{}{好。我是}

#{164}{}{.}
{164}{}{。}

#{165}{}{How about I show you my boot?}
{165}{}{我给你脸上盖个鞋底印怎么样？}

#{166}{LOX_22}{This is the famous Thieves' Circle!  I thought you would've known this, seeing's how you made it through all the defenses and whatnot.  But no matter.  You're quite promising, and the Circle could use someone like you.}
{166}{LOX_22}{这儿是著名的盗贼工会！看你通过防御的身手，我还以为你知道的。不过没关系，你很有发展前途，工会需要你这样的人。}

#{167}{}{Okay, what do I have to do?}
{167}{}{好，我需要做什么？}

#{168}{}{No thanks. I would like to ask you some questions, though.}
{168}{}{不了，谢谢。我就是想问你几个问题。}

#{169}{}{Not a chance.}
{169}{}{没门儿。}

#{170}{LOX_23}{Well, you made it through my defenses so you certainly have skills.  What's your name?}
{170}{LOX_23}{嗯，你通过了我的防御系统，你一定身手不凡。你叫什么？}

#{171}{}{I'm }
{171}{}{我是}

#{172}{}{.}
{172}{}{。}

#{173}{}{What's it to you?}
{173}{}{关你屁事？}

#{174}{}{What is this place?}
{174}{}{这是什么地方？}


# TRANSLATION NOTE: The following line is the player addressing Loxley (who is male).

#{176}{}{You talk like an idiot.}
{176}{}{你讲话像个白痴。}

#{177}{LOX_24}{What the hell do you want?}
{177}{LOX_24}{你他妈的想怎么样？}

#{178}{}{What did I do? Why so hostile?}
{178}{}{我干什么了？你怎么这么冲？我招你惹你啦？}

#{179}{}{To be away from you.}
{179}{}{我马上就走。}


# TRANSLATION NOTE: The following line is the player addressing Loxley (who is male).
#{180}{}{Hey, I'm on your side. I'm here as a friend.}
{180}{}{嘿，我和你是一条道上的。我来这里和你交个朋友嘛。}


#{181}{LOX_25}{I don't like you. Don't know why, don't care.}
{181}{LOX_25}{我不喜欢你。不知道为什么，我不管。}

#{182}{}{Give me a chance!}
{182}{}{给我个机会吧！}

#{183}{}{Well, you're just an idiot then, aren't you?}
{183}{}{呃，那你丫就是个蠢蛋，不是吗？}

#{184}{LOX_26}{Thanks for such a lovely moment.  Jasmine, show our guest out.}
{184}{LOX_26}{真是感谢你的盛情。茉莉，送客。}

#{185}{LOX_27}{Oh, how nice to see you again.  Do you have a little something for me?}
{185}{LOX_27}{啊，再次见到你真高兴。你给我带来什么东西了吗？}

#{186}{}{My resignation. I decided not to take your stupid test.}
{186}{}{我的辞呈。我不想做你的蠢测试了。}

#{187}{}{I didn't get it yet.}
{187}{}{我还没弄到手。}

#{188}{}{Here's the necklace . . .}
{188}{}{给你项链……}

#{189}{LOX_29}{Ha!  Ha!  Well, done!  Congratulations.  You're now a member of the world famous Thieves' Circle.  Let's get Jasmine over here, and throw a topper, shall we?}
{189}{LOX_29}{哈！哈！干得好！恭喜。你现在已经成为世界著名的盗贼工会的一员了。让我们把茉莉叫来，一起庆祝一番，如何？}

#{190}{LOX_30}{Oh, how funny.  I really must tell you, though, that I don't care much for this kind of a joke.  Kind of a chuckle.  Kind of a put-one-over-on-the-old-Loxley thing huh.  Tell you what.  One more chance.  Bring the necklace here.}
{190}{LOX_30}{靠，真她妈的逗啊。虽然我不介意这种玩笑、这种白痴玩笑、这种侮辱我洛克西里的玩笑，但我真的必须无奈的告诉你，给你最后一次机会。把项链带回来！}

#{191}{LOX_31}{You're really just a complete pain in the ass, aren't you?}
{191}{LOX_31}{你果真他妈的就是个废物，不是吗？}

#{192}{LOX_32}{Stupid!  Oh.  I'm so disappointed you feel this way.  Ah, well, our little Circle will just have to carry on without your scintillating presence.  So sad.  Jasmine, the door for our guest.  And no return privileges, hmm?}
{192}{LOX_32}{愚蠢！唉。你如此抉择让我很失望。啊，好吧，我们的盗贼工会会在缺少你这员干将的情况下继续运作。茉莉，送客。也别再回来了，明白吗？}

#{193}{LOX_33}{Then what the bloody, bloody hell are you doing here?  Shoo!  Go away.  Only this time come back with the necklace.}
{193}{LOX_33}{我日，日，日啊，那你他妈在这里干吗？去！快滚。不拿到项链就别回来。}

#{194}{}{Anything interesting go on around here?}
{194}{}{这有什么有趣的事情发生吗？}

#{195}{}{Tell me about the Hub.}
{195}{}{跟我讲讲哈勃城的事。}

#{196}{}{Heard any good rumors lately?}
{196}{}{最近听到什么新闻了吗？}

#{197}{}{Tell me more about the Circle.}
{197}{}{给我详细介绍下工会。}

#{198}{}{I'm looking for the missing caravans. Any suggestions?}
{198}{}{我在找失踪的商队。有线索吗？}

#{199}{LOX_35}{Well, the whole bloody town's in an uproar, what with the missing caravans and all.  Something of a pain.  Cuts into the Circle's business, don't you know?}
{199}{LOX_35}{呃，全城都他妈的因为失踪的商队而骚动了。这很不爽。断了盗贼工会的财路，知道吗？}

#{200}{}{Do you know who might be responsible?}
{200}{}{你知道是谁干得吗？}

#{201}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you some more questions?}
{201}{}{谢谢。我能再问几个问题吗？}

#{202}{LOX_36}{I don't know, but I hope they find out soon.  People are edgy and it makes our job a bit more sticky, say what?  Not to mention all the superstitious nonsense floating about.}
{202}{LOX_36}{不知道，不过我希望能尽快查清楚。人们很紧张，这让我们的工作有点扎手，是吧？那些外边散布的迷信鬼话更是闹心啊。}

#{203}{}{What kind of nonsense?}
{203}{}{什么样的鬼话？}

#{204}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you some more questions?}
{204}{}{谢谢。我能再问几个问题吗？}

#{205}{LOX_37}{Oh, some bosh and bother that the Death Claw grabbed the caravans, and brought them up to its lair for an afternoon tea.}
{205}{LOX_37}{哦，一些狗屁不通的谣言说，商队被死亡爪抓到洞里当午后茶点了。}

#{206}{}{Sounds yummy. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{206}{}{那帮畜生还真是知道美味啊。我能再问几个问题吗？}

#{207}{LOX_38A}{Oh, absolutely.  We're all friends here.}
{207}{LOX_38A}{啊，没问题。我们现在是朋友。}

#{208}{lox_38b}{[Sigh]  Why not?}
{208}{lox_38b}{【叹气】好吧。}

#{209}{LOX_38C}{Ask away, ask away.}
{209}{LOX_38C}{快问，快问。}

#{210}{LOX_39}{No, actually.  You had one.  Consider yourself lucky.  Goodbye, ta-ta.}
{210}{LOX_39}{实际上不行了。你已经问了一个。自求多福吧。后会有期。}

#{211}{lox_40}{Nothing you'd be interested in.}
{211}{lox_40}{没什么你会感兴趣的。}

#{212}{}{Try me.}
{212}{}{不一定啊，试试嘛。}

#{213}{}{Okay, thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{213}{}{哦，谢谢。我能再问几个问题吗？}

#{214}{LOX_41}{Oh nothing.  Just the whole damn town's been up in arms with all the missing caravans.  That's all.}
{214}{LOX_41}{没什么。不过是全城都他妈的因为失踪商队的事而武装了起来。就这点事。}

#{215}{}{Gee, thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{215}{}{啊，谢谢。我能再问几个问题吗？}

#{216}{LOX_42}{Oh, just the usual.  The merchant caravans get fat off the poor, while that villain Decker plays off everyone.}
{216}{LOX_42}{啊，和往常一样。商队靠骗穷人的钱越来越富，恶棍德克挑拨各派互殴从中渔利。}

#{217}{LOX_43}{Well, you've got the usual numbers of shops and things.  Mix in some Children of the Cathedral nut cases.  Add a dollop of Decker and his underground making life hard for us all.  Top it with a sprinkle of greedy merchants and that will jus#t about cover it.}
{217}{LOX_43}{嗯，商店和铺子已经不少了，大教堂教徒还尽来添乱，外加德克帮和他的地下组织让全城人的日子都不爽。最操蛋的就是那些奸商，这就是大概情况吧。}

#{218}{}{Merchants are pretty much scum, huh?}
{218}{}{商人就是一堆极品杂碎，对吧？}

#{219}{}{Sounds like you're a real Decker supporter.}
{219}{}{听起来你还是德克的粉丝啊。}

#{220}{LOX_43A}{Next question, please.}
{220}{LOX_43A}{请进入下一问题。}

#{221}{LOX_44}{Too right!  That's why the Circle was formed, you see.  You got all those rich buggers, feeding off the poor.  And those poor are just waiting for a hero.  Because of the help we give them, they practically bow at our feet.}
{221}{LOX_44}{太对了！这就是盗贼工会成立的原因，明白吧。这些有钱的蛀虫对穷人敲骨吸髓。穷人在等待一个英雄。因为我们劫富济贫，他们对我们毕恭毕敬的。}

#{222}{}{What's wrong with making money?}
{222}{}{捞钱有什么不对？}

#{223}{}{Just like Robin Hood.}
{223}{}{就像罗宾汉。}

#{224}{LOX_47}{What's the harm?!  you little...well, I was wrong about you, wasn't I?  Jasmine, show this merchant's boot licker the door!}
{224}{LOX_47}{有什么不对？！你个……算了，我错看你了，不是吗？茉莉，把这个商人的走狗请出去！}

#{225}{LOX_48}{You know the story!  I knew there was something special about you.  Ah, me granddad told that one a long time ago.  Now there was a thief!  But enough of that.  Anything else you need to ask?}
{225}{LOX_48}{你知道那个故事！！我知道你很特别。啊，那是我爷爷告诉我的，他说很久很久以前，有一个义贼……好了，暂且打住。你还需要问什么？}

#{226}{LOX_51}{Other than the missing caravans, not much.  Oh, wait.  One of my lads came back yesterday all a-glow with a touch of radiation poisoning.  Nasty business.  Probably tip-toed a bit too close to the old Hot Spot.}
{226}{LOX_51}{除了失踪商队的事，没什么了。啊，等下。我有个兄弟昨天全身放光的带着辐射回来了。真恶心。可能是和辐射点离得太近了。}

#{227}{LOX_53}{We steal from the rich, plain and simple.  We give about, oh, ten to twenty percent to the poor folks over in Old Town.  The Circle keeps twenty, which leaves the rest for the thief.  Not a bad deal all round.}
{227}{LOX_53}{简单的说呢，我们偷那些有钱人。我们把大约，呃，10%到20%分给旧城区的穷人。组织保留20%，其余留给那个贼。还算公平合理。}

#{228}{LOX_54}{We're a bunch of crooks!  What did you think we were, a bunch of cooks?}
{228}{LOX_54}{我们是骗子！你认为我们是什么？厨子？}

#{229}{LOX_55A}{You could check with the merchants, although your time would be better spent sizing them up for some night removal work.  While I think it's absolute bunk, ask around about the Death Claw.  Or even follow a caravan out, if you've totally l#ost your mind.}
#先这么翻吧
{229}{LOX_55A}{你可以和商人们谈谈，但那基本上就是浪费时间，还不如晚上直接去他们家搬家。你也可以去找死亡爪打听下，不过我认为这太扯了。或者，如果你真的脑子进水了就直接跟一队商人出去。}

#{230}{LOX_55B}{Well, how the bloody hell should I know?  Do I look like a merchant?}
{230}{LOX_55B}{哈，我他妈的怎么会知道？我看起来像个商人吗？}

#{231}{LOX_56}{Couple of ground rules.  One, don't ever get caught, and two, never, ever steal from the Circle.  Put it down.}
{231}{LOX_56}{有几条规矩。第一，任何时候都别被抓住，第二，永远、永远也不准从工会偷东西。记住。}

#{232}{LOX_57}{You just don't have the hang of this, do you?  Jasmine, the door for our foolish friend and don't let me see that face again.}
{232}{LOX_57}{这个你就不必费心了。茉莉，送我们的傻蛋出门，别让我再看见他。}

#{233}{LOX_58}{I don't think you quite understand.  Save it for the merchants, yes?}
{233}{LOX_58}{我觉得你还不明白。这样的屁话你还是留给商人吧，好吗？}

#{234}{LOX_59}{What the bloody hell are you doing in here?  Get out!}
{234}{LOX_59}{你他奶奶的在这里做什么？滚！}

#{235}{LOX_60}{You see, it's like I said...}
{235}{LOX_60}{听着，我说过……}

#{236}{LOX_61}{Well, as I said...}
{236}{LOX_61}{唉，我说过了……}

#{237}{LOX_62}{Are you just thick?  I told you...}
{237}{LOX_62}{你是不是真的傻了？我跟你说过的……}

#{238}{LOX_63}{Which are you, deaf or stupid?  Like I said...}
{238}{LOX_63}{你是聋子还是白痴？我说过了……}

#{239}{LOX_64}{It's no fun repeating myself.}
{239}{LOX_64}{一遍遍地说可不好玩。}

#{240}{LOX_65}{Ugh!  It's no use.  Obviously no amount of pounding can possibly get that information into your thick skull.}
{240}{LOX_65}{唉！没办法。对牛弹琴。}

#{241}{LOX_66}{No.  Decker's a slick one.  He's got the whole town in his pocket, he does.  He gives his 'protection' to the merchants, all the while pitting them against each other.  Not someone you want to mess with, but he can usually be found in the M#altese Falcon.}
{241}{LOX_66}{不。德克是个老油条。他玩弄全城于鼓掌之间，真的。他罩着商人们，但同时一直叫他们互相内讧。那家伙可不是你能惹得起的，不过你如果真的要见他的话，通常可以在马耳他猎鹰酒吧那里找到他。}

#{242}{LOX_67}{He's a gun dealer up in the north part of Old Town.  Damn dangerous bloke, some of his hardware's a bit too lethal.}

#{244}{LOX_69}{Harold?  He's a good enough sort, for being a ghoul an all.  Lives on the south side.}
{244}{LOX_69}{哈罗德？从做为一个僵尸的角度讲，那老小子还不错。他住在南边。}

#{245}{LOX_70}{Decker's right hand man, definitely not one to mess with.  You can usually find him at the Maltese Falcon.}
{245}{LOX_70}{德克的左右手，不是好惹的人。你一般能在马耳他猎鹰找到他。}

#{246}{LOX_71}{Them.  Sitting high and mighty in their Water Tower south of downtown, charging all us decent folks for any drop of water that springs from the ground.  They should all be bloody shot, they should.}
{246}{LOX_71}{他们。牛皮哄哄坐在他们位于市中心南部的水塔里边，为了每一滴从地上冒出来的水向我们收费。他们都该他妈的拖出去枪毙，绝对应该。}

#{247}{LOX_72}{They have a little general shop downtown.  Can't trust'em, though.  Hiding in their bloody warehouse most of the time.  They do sell some mean drugs and medkits, though.  A lot cheaper than the stupid Children of the Cathedral, I can tell y#ou that.}
{247}{LOX_72}{他们在市中心开了个杂货店。虽然不值得信任。他们一般都躲在那个狗窝仓库里。不过，他们卖一些劣质毒品和药品。比大教堂的教徒都便宜。这就是我能告诉你的。}

{248}{LOX_73}{他们是三个商队中还算有点人样的。不过也好不到哪里去。}

{249}{LOX_74}{他们是罪犯！绝对是罪犯！他们使这座城镇半死不活。远行商队，深红商队，还有最垃圾的一群，纯水商队。很多很多，都是王八操的。}

#{250}{lox_75}{It's down in the middle of town.}
{250}{lox_75}{它坐落在市中心。}

{251}{LOX_76}{真没什么好说的。半夜，用来吓小孩的故事－一头住在北边的野兽到处找坏小孩吃。}

#{252}{LOX_77}{Seems like every day another one turns up missing.  People are afraid to leave town without protection.  Some even blame it on the Death Claw.}
{252}{LOX_77}{似乎每天都有人被发现失踪。人们害怕在没有护卫的情况下离开城市。有的人把这归咎于死亡爪。}

{255}{LOX_80}{很棒的房子。用穷人们的血汗换来的。}

{256}{LOX_81}{你总能在商业区的市场中心找到鲍勃。如果他还没有死翘翘，他很可能在卖他的蜥蜴串。}

#{257}{LOX_82}{Now there's a scary bunch.  They strut around all day talking about their Night God, as if he's the next best thing since merchant pockets with holes.  They can heal you up pretty cheap.  I'll give'em that.  You can find'em in that hospital# of theirs downtown.}
{257}{LOX_82}{目前有一伙让人很不安的人。他们整天到处大肆宣扬他们的黑暗上帝，就好像他的出现是比商人们的口袋破了洞都好的事情。他们可以廉价的帮你看病。我都付得起。你可以在他们市中心的医院找到他们。}
