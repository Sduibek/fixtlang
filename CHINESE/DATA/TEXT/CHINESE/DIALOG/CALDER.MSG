#{122}{}{I heard Father Morpheus had a visit from the Master himself. He's real happy right now.}
{122}{}{我听说墨菲斯神父被主教接见了，他现在很高兴。}
#{123}{}{Anything else?}

#{135}{}{The Nightkin are my friends.}
{135}{}{夜行团是我的哥们儿。}
#{136}{}{You're a little too young to understand how much fun I can be.}
{136}{}{你太小了，还不知道我有多好玩。}
#{137}{}{Go ahead. And I'll tell them about you.}
{137}{}{再说，我把你告诉他们！}
#{138}{}{You start telling anyone about me, kid, and you're dead!}
{138}{}{你想告密？小子，你死定了！}
#{139}{}{Sure is. I picked it myself from a grove across town. Well, it was nice meeting you. May the Master bless you.}
{139}{}{当然了，我是从城外的草地上摘的，很高兴认识你，主教保佑你。}

#{144}{}{Sorry kid. I'm not a flower kinda guy.}
{144}{}{抱歉，小鬼，我可不是喜欢花的娘娘腔。}
#{145}{}{Sorry kid. You're a little too young to be giving me flowers.}
{145}{}{抱歉，小鬼，你还没到送我花花的年纪呐。}
#{146}{}{I dunno. Why you ask?}
{146}{}{我不知道，你问这个做什么？}
#{147}{}{I can't tell you that! The Nightkin would eat me!}
{147}{}{我不能说那个！夜行团会吃了我的。}
#{148}{}{He's my teacher. He says every lash we receive brings us closer to the Master!}
{148}{}{他是我老师，他说加在我们身上的每一鞭都让我们更接近主教！}
#{149}{}{What a charming man. We really must talk.}
{149}{}{这个人倒颇有魅力，我一定要会会。}
#{150}{}{Don't believe him kid.}
{150}{}{别被他忽悠了，小鬼。}
#{151}{}{Where is this bastard? I'll kill him.}
{151}{}{这个畜生在哪里？我要废了他。}
#{152}{}{Teacher? What need teacher?}

#{156}{}{But the Nightkin like me! They told me that if anyone bothered me, they'd kill 'em. So there!}
{156}{}{夜行团喜欢我！他们说谁要欺负我他们就灭谁，怎么样！}
#{157}{}{I heard there's a secret passage around here, but I haven't
# found it yet. Supposed to be real dangerous. Only
# Morpheus and the Nightkin are allowed there.
# Well, I'd better go. Praise the Master!}
{157}{}{我知道这附近有个秘道，我也没找到。也许会很危险。只有墨菲斯和夜行团才准去那里。哦，我走了，赞美主教！}
#{158}{}{That's too bad. May the Master bless you anyway.}
{158}{}{太糟了，希望主教还能保佑你。}
#{159}{}{Please don't tell him I said anything to you! Please!}
{159}{}{别跟他说是我说的！拜托！}
#{160}{}{Don't worry. When I'm through with him, he won't remember a thing.}
{160}{}{不用担心，我和他会面后，他就什么也记不住了。}
#{161}{}{I won't. I promise.}
{161}{}{不会的，我保证。}
#{162}{}{Mind your own business, kid.}
{162}{}{少管我的事，小鬼。}

#{164}{}{Life is tough. Learn to take it, kid, and quit whining.}
{164}{}{生活是艰难的，学会接受它，孩子，抱怨是没有用的}
#{165}{}{But I must! I must! Disbelief is pain!}

#{166}{}{Please don't! He loves me! He's the only one who does.}

#{167}{}{That's okay, I guess. May the Master bless you. Bye.}
{167}{}{好吧，愿主教保佑你。再见。}
#{168}{}{Thank you! Oh thank you! May the Master bless you. Bye.}
{168}{}{多谢！多谢！愿主教保佑你！再见。}
#{169}{}{Okay I will . . . (sniff) Maybe Father Lasher will be more kind to me after the Master takes over the world.}
{169}{}{好吧，我会……【抽泣】也许主教控制世界后，拉舍尔会对我好一点。}
#{171}{}{And when's the Master going to take over the world?}
{171}{}{主教什么时候统治世界？}
#{172}{}{Tell me more about this, kid.}
{172}{}{告诉我更多，孩子。}
#{173}{}{He won't be. He'll get worse. But if you're smart, make yourself her favorite and he'll let you torture the new kids that come in.}
{173}{}{他不会对你好的，只会对你更坏。你要是聪明点，就讨好他，他就会让你糟践那些新来的小鬼。哈哈。}
#{174}{}{Ugh! Me like kindness.}
{174}{}{吼吼！我喜欢好人。}
#{175}{}{Soon, or so they tell me. We're going to have peace, and unity and the Holy Flame will be lit. And maybe Father Morpheus won't be quite so loud, either.}
{175}{}{快了，他们这样跟我说，我们就要获得和平了，同一和圣火会发扬光大的。也许墨菲斯神父再也不会那么大声说话了。}
#{176}{}{Anything else?}
{176}{}{还有呢？}
#{177}{}{Father Morpheus?}
{177}{}{墨菲斯神父？}
#{178}{}{Loud sucks!}
{178}{}{就是只会大叫的混账！}
#{179}{}{Uh, I really don't know very much. Honest. Bless the Master! Bye!}
{179}{}{唔，我知道的不多，真的。主教保佑你！拜拜！}
#{180}{}{Hi. How are you?}
{180}{}{嗨，最近如何？}
#{181}{}{Fine, kid. What's the good news?}
{181}{}{很好，孩子，有什么新消息？}
#{182}{}{Okay. So you got any dirt for your old friend?}
{182}{}{很好，你有没有什么新料要告诉老朋友？}
#{183}{}{Pretty good. How about you?}
{183}{}{不赖，你呢？}
#{184}{}{I dunno. Bored.}
{184}{}{我也不知道，好无聊。}
#{185}{}{I feel lousy. Do you know how long it's been since I killed anything?}
{185}{}{无聊透了，你知道多久我没开杀戒了……}
#{186}{}{Uh, hello.}
{186}{}{哦，你好。}
#{187}{}{Hello kid. Can you tell me what this place is about?}
{187}{}{你好，小鬼，这里是什么地方？}
#{188}{}{Hi kid. What're you doing in this joint?}
{188}{}{嗨，小鬼，你在这里做啥？}
#{189}{}{Hi kid. How're you doing?}
{189}{}{嗨，小鬼，过的怎样？}
#{190}{}{Out of my face, brat, or I'll turn you into a belt!}
{190}{}{滚开，小杂碎，信不信我把你打成烂肉！}
#{191}{}{Hello? Rhyme with yellow! Funny!}
{191}{}{你好，啊罗，你好，啊罗，有趣！}
#{192}{}{This is the Cathedral of the Children of the Cathedral.
# I don't know why they say Cathedral twice. We worship the
# Master, and we yell a lot about Peace and Unity.
# It sounds kind of dumb, but the Master's real smart,
# so I guess it must be okay.}
{192}{}{这里是大教堂，大教堂。我也不知道为什么要说两遍大教堂。我们信仰主教大人，呼唤和平和同一。看起来有点老调，但主教真的很英明，所以我觉得挺好。}
#{193}{}{Tell me more about the Master.}
{193}{}{说说你们的主教。}
#{194}{}{Sounds dumb to me, too. What are you doing here?}
{194}{}{我也觉得老土，你在这里做什么？}
#{195}{}{Don't talk about your elders that way, okay?}
{195}{}{别这样随便谈论你的前辈，知道吗？}
#{196}{}{What kind of a brainwashed little fool are you? You're going to grow up to be one of these zombies! I should kill you now!}
{196}{}{你是个被洗脑的小笨蛋，你长大后会变僵尸的！杀了你算了。}
#{197}{}{I give out flowers. Every petal is peace, and the stem is unity. Or are the petals unity and the stem peace? Oh no, I don't remember! Do you want one?}
{197}{}{我送花，每片花瓣象征和平，花茎象征同一。不对……花茎象征和平，花瓣象征同一？哎呀，不记得了，你要花吗？}
#{198}{}{I'll take one if you tell me what's going on around here.}
{198}{}{如果你给我说说这里的事情，我就要一朵。}
#{199}{}{Sure.}
{199}{}{好啊。}
#{200}{}{No, thanks.}
{200}{}{不用，谢谢。}
#{201}{}{Screw peace. Screw unity. And get that flower out of my face!}
{201}{}{狗屁和平，狗屁同一，把你的猪草从我脸上拿走！}
#{202}{}{Father Lasher says I shouldn't talk to strangers . . . until we have Unity, of course; then nobody'll be a stranger. Bye!}
{202}{}{拉舍尔神父说我不能与陌生人讲话……除非我们实现同一了。那时候谁都不是外人了，再见。}
#{203}{}{I'm okay. At least until Father Lasher's next lesson.}
{203}{}{还好，起码在拉舍尔下次给我上课之前还算好。}
#{204}{}{Maybe if you studied harder, the lessons wouldn't be so bad.}
{204}{}{你用点功啊，下次上课就没那么难熬了。}
#{205}{}{Tell me more about Father Lasher.}
{205}{}{说说这位拉舍尔神父。}
#{206}{}{What kind of lesson?}
{206}{}{什么样的课？}
#{207}{}{Stop whining, you little brat, and be grateful that somebody's bothering to teach you!}
{207}{}{别哭哭啼啼的，小鬼，你该为有人这样费心给你上课而感激！}
#{208}{}{I never do good enough! Never!}
{208}{}{我怎么用功都不够好！永远不够好！}
#{209}{}{【done】}
{209}{}{【完成】}
