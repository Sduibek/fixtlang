#{100}{}{You see a Master Merchant}
#{101}{}{Arrest this thief!}
#{102}{}{...I don't care what they say.  We need new parts... Oh, yes.  Sorry. What #can I do for you?}
#{103}{}{I want a job.}
#{104}{}{Do you have a water chip?}
#{105}{}{Nothing, bye.}
#{106}{}{Shek.}
#{107}{}{Sure, great.  You're hired.  Wait.  What position?  Oh, caravan guard #right?  Yeah, sure. You can work for us.  You look okay.  Anything else?}
#{108}{}{Nope.}
#{109}{}{Yes, do you have a water chip?}
#{110}{}{Veh?}
#{111}{}{Sorry, no time for nonsense!}
#{112}{}{Water chip... hmm.  Oh, those old Vault purifying control chips.  Well, I'm #sure I speak for the entire town when I say
# you won't find one here.  Without the proper equipment they're worthless.  Only #a Vault, or maybe Necropolis would have any
# use for one.  Why do you ask?}
#{113}{}{Necropolis?  Why would they need one?}
#{114}{}{My vault's chip broke and I'm looking for a replacement.}
#{115}{}{Just curious.}
#{116}{}{I can't say.}
#{117}{}{Really? Well as you probably have heard, we supply a great deal of water #throughout the area.  I am sure we could
# arrange to send a caravan up to your Vault for a fee.}
#{118}{}{How much are we talking about?}
#{119}{}{I don't know if I can trust you.}
#{120}{}{No thanks.}
#{121}{}{Yeah, if you say so.}
#{122}{}{Then I'm sorry, I don't think I can help.}
#{123}{}{Can't trust me?!?  I'm routinely trusted to deliver water to people far more #paranoid than yourself!  What do you
# think we are?  Terrorists?}
#{124}{}{Okay fine.  How much money do you want to start the Caravans.}
#{125}{}{I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to imply anything, but I can't take the risk.}
#{126}{}{Well, if you change your mind let me know. I'm very curious now.}
#{127}{}{Hello again.}
#{128}{}{I need a water chip.}
#{129}{}{I'm still looking for a water chip.}
#{130}{}{I want a job.}
#{131}{}{Bye.}
#{132}{}{Sure, great.  You're hired.  Wait.  What position?  Oh, caravan guard #right?  Yeah, sure.  You can work for us.  You look okay.}
#{133}{}{We already went through this.  Are you willing to pay the price to have the #water caravans start?}
#{134}{}{Earlier you mentioned that Necropolis might have a water chip.  Why would #they need one?}
#{135}{}{How much are we talking about?}
#{136}{}{No, not yet.}
#{137}{}{Well, it's just a guess really.  We tried to start a caravan route to #Necropolis once, but they refused to trade with us.
#  Nobody in their right mind refuses water these days unless they have a reliable #supply.  I figure they must have their own
# purifier or they would have died out a long time ago.  So are you looking to have #us go up to your Vault?}
#{138}{}{Yes, how much is it going to cost me?}
#{139}{}{No thanks.}
#{140}{}{Well, it is quite a distance away.  2000 caps should cover the initial #caravan, and I'm sure your Vault will
# have stuff to trade to keep us going for a while.  However with our current reserves, #I'm guessing that we will only be
# able to keep your Vault going for an extra 100 days or so.}
#{141}{}{Alright, here is the money.}
#{142}{}{The Vault should be able to take care of most of your initial payment.  Why #don't I give you 1000 instead to start.}
#{143}{}{It is quite a ways, but the Vault has plenty of goods to reimburse you for #your upfront money.  So, how about 500 instead?}
#{144}{}{I don't have the cash, I'll come back when I do.}
#{145}{}{It looks like you don't have enough money, come back when you do.  Remember #you need }
#{146}{}{ caps.}
#{147}{}{Ok, I can start sending the caravans up to your Vault today.  Now you ought #to know, the caravans are pretty visible going
# across the desert.   So, sending the caravans out that way is going to paint a pretty #good picture for anyone that might be
# looking for your Vault.   Are you still sure you want them sent out that way?}
#{148}{}{I guess not.}
#{149}{}{Yes, the Vault needs water.}
#{150}{}{That sounds fair enough.  The technology from the Vaults can fetch a pretty #good price down here in the Hub.}
#{151}{}{Sorry but I can only accept full payment.}
#{152}{}{That sounds fair enough.  The technology from the Vaults can fetch a pretty #good price down here in the Hub.}
#{153}{}{Sorry but I can only accept full payment.}
#{154}{}{Are you going to pay the amount I asked for to get the water caravans #rolling?}
#{155}{}{Ok, they'll start off in a few hours.}
#{156}{}{I'm sorry, but the Water Merchants will not associate with you any longer.}
#{157}{}{Do you have the }
#{158}{}{ caps for us to start the water caravan to your vault?}

{100}{}{你看到一名商队头目}
{101}{}{把这个小偷抓起来！}
{102}{}{……我才不在意他们说什么。我需要新的市场……哦，抱歉，有什么可帮忙的吗？}
{103}{}{我需要份工作。}
{104}{}{你这里有净水芯片吗？}
{105}{}{没有，再见。}
{106}{}{嘘。}
{107}{}{当然，很好。你被雇佣了。等等。你能做些什么？哦，护卫吗？太棒了，我们正需要你这种人。还有别的事吗？}
{108}{}{不是。}
{109}{}{是的，你这里有净水芯片吗？}
{110}{}{喔？}
{111}{}{抱歉，我没时间闲扯！}
{112}{}{净水芯片……嗯。哦，你是说那些过去避难所里的净化控制芯片。不过我很确定在这里找不到你想要的东西。没有适用的设备那芯片就毫无价值。只有在避难所和大墓地能找到。你为什么对这个感兴趣？}
{113}{}{大墓地？他们干嘛需要这东西？}
{114}{}{因为我们避难所里的芯片坏掉了，急需一个替换。}
{115}{}{只是有点好奇。}
{116}{}{我说不好。}
{117}{}{真的吗？也许你听说过，这片土地的净水供给都是我们在负责。只要你出得起价钱，我们也会照看避难所的。}
{118}{}{多少钱？}
{119}{}{我不确定是否该相信你。}
{120}{}{别客气。}
{121}{}{好吧，既然你这么说。}
{122}{}{那么对不起了，我也没什么可帮你的。}
{123}{}{信不过我？！？我在这行里的声誉远远超乎你的想象。你认为我们是什么？恐怖分子吗？}
{124}{}{好的好的。咱们还是说说价钱吧。}
{125}{}{很抱歉，我并不是那个意思。但我还是不能冒这个险。}
{126}{}{好吧，如果你改变了想法就来找我。我可是很有兴趣的。}
{127}{}{再一次问候你。}
{128}{}{我需要一块净水芯片。}
{129}{}{我仍在找净水芯片。}
{130}{}{我需要一份工作。}
{131}{}{再见。}
{132}{}{当然，很好。你被雇佣了。等等。你能做些什么？哦，护卫吗？太棒了，我们正需要你这种人。}
{133}{}{我们以前去过那里。价格上没问题的话我们就可以出发了。}
{134}{}{刚才你提到大墓地可能有一块净水芯片，他们为什么需要那个？}
{135}{}{那东西值多少钱？}
{136}{}{不，还没有。}
{137}{}{哦，那是我猜的。我们曾找他们谈过生意，但他们不需要。这年头除非有自己的净水系统，否则没人会拒绝纯净的水。所以我想他们一定有，不然早成人干了。那么说回来你需要我们的服务吗？}
{138}{}{好的，多少钱？}
{139}{}{不客气。}
{140}{}{你也知道这段路很长而且也不太平。２０００个瓶盖并不太贵，并且我相信你们的避难所里也会有我需要的东西。不管怎么说，凭我这里目前的储量让你们的避难所多维持１００多天还是没问题的。}
{141}{}{成交。}
{142}{}{避难所会支付给你大部分费用的。我先给你１０００个瓶盖好吗？}
{143}{}{这段路确实不大好走，不过避难所有着丰富的储备可以满足你的需求。那么５００个瓶盖怎么样？}
{144}{}{我现在钱不够，一旦够数我马上回来。}
{145}{}{看起来你的钱不够，等有钱再来吧。记住，你需要}
{146}{}{个瓶盖。}
{147}{}{好的，我们今天就动身。不过你得明白，穿越荒漠的商队是非常显眼的。因此，将会有很多出于各种目的的人尾随而至。你最好考虑清楚。}
{148}{}{我想那还是别去了。}
{149}{}{当然，避难所需要净水。}
{150}{}{这听起来相当公平。在这儿避难所的科技应该能买个好价钱。}
{151}{}{很抱歉我这里不讲价。}
{152}{}{这听起来相当公平。在这儿避难所的科技应该能买个好价钱。}
{153}{}{很抱歉我这里不讲价。}
{154}{}{你到底有没有打算付钱？}
{155}{}{好的，几小时后我们就出发。}
{156}{}{抱歉，我们纯水商队不会再和你合作了。}
{157}{}{你准备付多少}
{158}{}{个瓶盖为这次和你们避难所的净水生意。}
