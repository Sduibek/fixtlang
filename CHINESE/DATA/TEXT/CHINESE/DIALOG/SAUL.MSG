#{128}{}{Well, you're in the right place if you're looking for someone to pound

{136}{}{你怎么成为一个拳手的？}
#{137}{}{Hmm. Well, stranger, I work for Gizmo. He's the owner of that great
# casino there. Pays good money to fighters here, too! What else do you want to
# know?}
{137}{}{嗯，好的，陌生人，我为吉斯莫工作。他是那个大赌场的拥有者。他也付给这儿的拳手好报酬！你还想知道什么？}

# was sponsoring organized fights, and I needed some money. Been boxing
# ever since.}
{141}{}{在我成长之时，我总是和我的兄弟们扭打在一起。一次一小伙歹徒袭击了吉斯莫，我在一个歹徒能拔枪对准我之前把他打得讨饶。只是运气，真的，不过吉斯莫那时赞助有组织的拳击，而我需要一些钱。从那时起就打拳了。}
#{142}{}{What happened to your brothers?}
{142}{}{你的弟兄们怎么了？}

{144}{}{你能告诉我关于你老板的事吗？}
#{145}{}{If you are just looking for supplies, you should try Killian Darkwater's
# store, off southeast of here. You can also get a night's sleep at the Crash
# House near here. If you are planning to stay a while, you might want to get
# a drink over at the Skum Pitt, but watch out for the Skulz.}
{145}{}{如果你只是在找补给，你应该去基利安・黑水的店，这儿东南边的远处。你也能在这儿附近的破屋区睡上一晚。如果你准备待一阵子的话，你该想去对面的斯卡姆・匹特的酒吧喝上一杯，但是留神骷髅党。}
#{146}{}{Who're the Skulz?}
{146}{}{骷髅党是哪路神仙？}
#{147}{}{So, tell me more about the casino.}
{147}{}{那么，再告诉我一些关于赌场的事。}

#{149}{}{What else is there to do around here?}
{149}{}{那个人还在这附近做什么呢？}
#{150}{}{My brother James was killed in a raider attack a few years ago. Shortly
# after that, my other brother, Darrell, gathered together some things and set
# off south towards a mythical place called the Glow, in search of the treasure of
# the ancients, or something like that. He never came back.}
{150}{}{我的兄弟詹姆斯很多年以前在一次歹徒袭击中被杀害了。那之后不久，我另一个兄弟，达雷尔，攒了一些东西便向南出发朝向一个叫闪光之地的神秘地方，寻找古代的财宝，或者一些类似的东西。他从没有回来。}

#{155}{}{Thank you. It's been a few years, but I still don't like to talk about
# it much.}
{155}{}{谢谢。这已经一些年了，但是我仍然不想谈论太多这事。}
#{156}{}{So, can I ask you some questions?}
{156}{}{那么，我能问你些问题吗？}
#{157}{}{I live here. I like boxing, I have a good life with Trish, and I have
# no desire to go elsewhere.}
{157}{}{我住在这儿。我喜欢拳击，我与特里诗过得很愉快，而且我没有去其它地方的冲动。}
#{158}{}{Oh. Well, that's good. Mind if we change the subject?}
{158}{}{哦。这样啊，那不错。介意我换个话题吗？}
#{159}{}{Yes, I've met Trish.}

#{165}{}{Thanks for chatting. See you around.}
{165}{}{闲谈受益匪浅。别处见。}
#{166}{}{The Skulz are a bad bunch who hang out in the back of the Crash House and
# at the Skum Pitt. Watch out for them; they like playing with knives.}
{166}{}{骷髅党是一帮在迦克镇破屋区后边和斯卡姆・匹特酒吧游荡的坏蛋。留神他们；他们喜欢玩弄刀子。}
#{167}{}{Thanks for the tip. I'll watch my step.}
{167}{}{感谢你的提示。我会当心的。}
#{168}{}{I see. Anything else you can tell me about?}
{168}{}{我明白了。还有什么你能告诉我的吗？}
#{169}{}{Well, be sure to keep your hands off, eh?}
{169}{}{好，切记不要乱摸，嗯？}
#{170}{}{She's very important to me.}
{170}{}{她对我很重要。}
#{171}{}{ 【Saul frowns.】 But she doesn't like my boxing. She doesn't seem to
# understand that it's what I want to do.}
{171}{}{【索尔皱了皱眉。】但是她不喜欢我搞拳击。她不见得明白这是我想做的。}
#{172}{}{She's concerned for your welfare. She probably can't stand to see you
# getting beaten up and risking your life for Gizmo. If you don't find a
# compromise, you could lose her.}
{172}{}{她关心你的幸福。她可能不能忍受看见你被打倒在地，为吉斯莫冒生命危险。如果你不找一个折衷的办法，你会失去她。}
#{173}{}{I think she's worried about you.}
{173}{}{我想她是担心你。}
#{174}{}{So, shall we talk about something else?}
{174}{}{那么，我们是不是谈些其它的？}
#{175}{}{Well, see you later.}
{175}{}{好，待会见。}
#{176}{}{I never thought of it that way. I figured that she just didn't like
# boxing. I suppose I will have to talk to her more about this. Thanks.}
{176}{}{我从没这样想过这事。我认为她只是不喜欢拳击。我猜想我不得不再与她多谈谈这事。谢了。}
#{177}{}{Ah, she just doesn't like boxing, is all.}
{177}{}{呃，她只是不喜欢拳击，这就是全部。}
#{178}{}{Well, can we talk about something else?}
{178}{}{好，我们能谈论些别的事吗？}
#{179}{}{See you around.}
{179}{}{别处见。}
#{180}{}{You again. What now?}
{180}{}{又是你。这回什么事？}
#{181}{}{Hello again.}
{181}{}{又见面了。}
#{182}{}{I'm here to teach you some manners.}

#{184}{}{Can you tell me about Junktown?}
{184}{}{你能告诉我关于迦克镇的事吗？}
#{185}{}{From what I've heard, the Glow is a great crater that glows at night. It's
# supposed to be far, far to the south, but I don't know where. Stories say that
# it's inhabited by all sorts of mutant freaks who guard the technology from before
# the War.}
{185}{}{从我所打听到的来说，闪光之地是一个晚上发光的大凹陷。它被认为在南边很远很远的地方，但是我不知道哪里。有消息说它被拥有战前科技的变种畸形人所占据。}
#{186}{}{I see. Thanks for the info.}
{186}{}{我明白了。感谢你的信息。}
#{187}{}{Interesting. Can you give me any more info?}
