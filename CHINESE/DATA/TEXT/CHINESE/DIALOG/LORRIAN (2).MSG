#{100}{}{You see a young woman with dark hair.}
#{101}{}{You see Lorraine, a Scav from Adytum.}
#{102}{}{Hi. Are you new here?}
#{103}{}{Yeah. Can you fill me in a little?}
#{104}{}{Yes, I am. I'm called }
#{105}{}{. }
#{106}{}{Whuuu?}
#{107}{}{I suppose. What do you need to know about?}
#{108}{}{Who are you?}
#{109}{}{Can you give me some information about the Boneyard?}
#{110}{}{Tell me a bit about the other residents of Adytum.}
#{111}{}{What do you do for a living?}
#{112}{}{Never mind, thanks.}
#{113}{}{I'm Lorraine.}
#{114}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
#{115}{}{I'm a Scav. I work with Sammael to collect stuff from the
# ruins, so that we can use it to build or trade.}
#{116}{}{Why doesn't everybody here do that?}
#{117}{}{How many Scavs are there?}
{100}{}{你看到一名黑发的年轻女子。}
{101}{}{你看到罗伊，一个来自内城区的拾荒者。}
{102}{}{您好，你是新来的吗？}
{103}{}{是的。能介绍一下这里吗？}
{104}{}{是的。我叫}
{105}{}{。}
{106}{}{喔？}
{107}{}{让我猜猜。你想知道什么？}
{108}{}{你是谁？}
{109}{}{你能跟我讲讲有关晒骨场的事情吗？}
{110}{}{告诉我些内城区居民的事好吗？}
{111}{}{你靠什么过活？}
{112}{}{谢谢，别担心。}
{113}{}{我是罗伊。}
{114}{}{我能问你几个问题吗？}
{115}{}{我是一个拾荒者。我和山谬一起在废墟里搜罗材料和资源，用来盖房子和做买卖。}
{116}{}{为什么这儿的人不都去做呢？}
#{118}{}{Can I ask you about something different?}
#{119}{}{Nice talking to you.}
#{120}{}{Well you got the Deathclaws out there, plus the Regulators take a percentage
# off the top, plus some for protection here in Adytum. Guess people don't have the #upfront
# cash, or the guts to stare a Deathclaw in the eye.}
#{121}{}{What's the deal with the Regulators?}
#{122}{}{How do you avoid the Deathclaws?}
#{123}{}{Can I ask you about some other stuff?}
#{124}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
#{125}{}{Oh, there's half a dozen of us. Sammael was the first one, and
# he's still the best.}
#{126}{}{Can I ask you about some other stuff?}
#{127}{}{Interesting. Thanks.}
#{128}{}{They keep the peace around here, and control all the money coming in and #going out.
# The rest of the people here pretty much work for the Regulators, and
# that ain't the most forgiving job. Many of them don't ever see
# beyond the fence that surrounds this place.}
#{129}{}{All that makes you wonder what Julianna was thinking.}
{117}{}{你们在这里有多少人手？}
{118}{}{咱们换个话题好吗？}
{119}{}{和你聊天很开心。}
{120}{}{你赶走了本地的死亡爪，另外自称为内城区保护神的管理者们就失分了。我猜那些人没现金付你，而且他们连看一眼死亡爪的胆量都没有。}
{121}{}{管理者们负责什么？}
{122}{}{你们怎么躲开死亡爪。}
{123}{}{我能问些其他的问题吗？}
{124}{}{谢谢。再见。}
{125}{}{哦，我们在这儿有半打的人。山谬就是一个，也是最好的一个。}
{126}{}{我能问些其它问题吗？}
{127}{}{很有意思，谢谢。}
{128}{}{他们维持本地的秩序，控制着这儿所有的的往来钞票。其他人要为他们卖苦力，而且要求很苛刻。他们中许多人根本不关心附近的情况。}
{129}{}{所有的一切都会你怀疑茱莉亚娜在想什么。}
#{130}{}{What do you mean about Julianna?}
#{131}{}{Very nasty. Can I ask some other things?}
#{132}{}{Thanks for the warning.}
#{133}{}{Oh, she wound up falling for some Blade a while ago. Poor
# dear can't leave the town, of course, and Caleb would kill
# the young lad on sight. Very tragic.}
#{134}{}{Uh . . . if you say so.}
#{135}{}{Can I ask some other questions?}
#{136}{}{Hmm. Thanks for filling me in. Bye.}
#{137}{}{We only scavenge after dark. And we're very good at what we
# do. Sammael's got a little test that he likes to throw out
# at people, before he lets them become Scavs.}
#{138}{}{What's the test?}
#{139}{}{Still sounds dangerous.}
#{140}{}{I see. Mind if we back up a bit?}
#{141}{}{Interesting. Bye.}
#{142}{}{Sammael has the person hide somewhere within Adytum during the
# day. If he can't find the student in an hour, then he lets
# the person join the next scavenger party.}
#{143}{}{What a stupid system!}
#{144}{}{Seems to work. You're still alive.}
#{145}{}{Huh. Can I ask you about some other things?}
#{146}{}{Interesting. Bye.}
{130}{}{能和我说说茱莉亚娜吗？}
{131}{}{太恶心了。咱们谈些别的好吗？}
{132}{}{多谢提醒。}
{133}{}{哦，前阵子她被几个利刃帮的混账缠住了。可怜的她再也不能离开这个镇子了，当然，卡勒布会杀光他看到的所有小伙。太惨了。}
{134}{}{哦……既然你这么说。}
{135}{}{我能问些其它问题吗？}
{136}{}{嗯，谢谢你告诉我这么多事情。再见}
{137}{}{我们只有天黑后才能干活。我们干这活也很拿手。对于想要加入我们的人，山谬有个小测试来考验这些人。}
{138}{}{什么样的测试？}
{139}{}{听起来还是很危险。}
{140}{}{我明白。我们会注意的。}
{141}{}{很有意思。再见。}
{142}{}{山谬让那个人白天藏在内城区的什么地方，如果1小时内山缪找不到他，他就能加入拾荒队了。}
{143}{}{真是个傻办法！}
{144}{}{别小看这工作。它至少可以让你生存。}
{145}{}{嗯。我能问你些其他的问题吗？}
{146}{}{很有意思。再见。}
#{147}{}{Come now, isn't there the faintest trace of a romantic in
# you? Really, it's too bad. Unrequited love and all of that.
# Tragic.}
#{148}{}{Hmpf. Shows what you know. Tell that to Sammael. If you
# can find him.}
#{149}{}{Yes, although it can be rough. It's very dangerous, especially
# if you're caught.}
#{150}{}{No doubt. Can I ask about something else?}
#{151}{}{Thanks for the info.}
#{152}{}{Wow, I think you're a little beyond my help.}
#{153}{}{This used to be a big city, called Los Angeles. But the
# bombs hit really hard. Now, there's just the Angel's
# Boneyard. We Adytowners are just trying to survive in the
# wreckage.}
#{154}{}{Can you tell me more about Los Angeles?}
#{155}{}{I see. Thanks.}
#{156}{}{Lots of people lived here. From what I hear, the survivors hid in
# a big place called a Vault, and came out years later. Some of
# them started the Regulators and then founded Adytum, while the }
#{157}{}{others formed the Blades. The Gun Runners aren't from here originally.}
#{158}{}{Where is this Vault?}
#{159}{}{What's the deal with the Regulators?}
{147}{}{此刻，你一点罗曼蒂克的感觉都没有？真的吗？这真是太糟了。那是无偿的爱和那所有的一切。你真无可救药了。}
{148}{}{嗯。如果你能找到山谬的话，把你所知道的告诉他。}
{149}{}{是的，而且它很凶猛。它非常危险，尤其你被抓住的时候。}
{150}{}{毫无疑问。我能问你些其他的问题吗？}
{151}{}{谢谢你告诉我这些。}
{152}{}{噢，很抱歉我帮不了你了。}
{153}{}{这里以前是个大城市，叫洛杉矶。但是一颗原子弹毁了一切。现在，这里叫晒骨场。我们内城区的居民都是在劫难中侥幸活下来的。}
{154}{}{你能多和我聊聊洛杉矶吗？}
{155}{}{我明白。谢谢。}
{156}{}{当年很多人都住在这。据我所知，这儿的大多数人当年都躲在一个叫避难所的大地方，并在几年后回到地面。其中一些人创立了管理者组织，建立了内城区。同时}
{157}{}{另一些人组成了利刃帮。而军火商则是后来出现的。}
{158}{}{避难所在哪？}
#{160}{}{Where are the Gun Runners from?}
#{161}{}{}
#{162}{}{Thanks for your help.}
#{163}{}{Well, supposedly it was somewhere south of here, but I don't
# know really. I think everyone left because it was broken.}
#{164}{}{Can I ask you some more questions?}
#{165}{}{Hmm. Thanks.}
#{166}{}{I'm not really sure. I think they came from somewhere up
# north of here.}
#{167}{}{What do you know abou the Regulators?}
#{168}{}{Can I ask about some other things?}
#{169}{}{Thanks for the information.}
#{170}{}{Who do you want to know about?}
#{171}{}{Jon Zimmerman.}
#{172}{}{Caleb.}
#{173}{}{Miles.}
#{174}{}{Tine.}
#{175}{}{Smitty.}
#{176}{}{Nobody.}
{159}{}{管理者们负责什么？}
{160}{}{那么军火商又是从哪里来的？}
{161}{}{}
{162}{}{谢谢你的帮助。}
{163}{}{据我想他们应该是来自这里南面点的地方，不过我并不确定。我只是觉得任何人都会想方设法离开那该死的破地方。}
{164}{}{我能再问些问题吗？}
{165}{}{嗯。谢谢。}
{166}{}{我不太确定。我想他们来自北面。}
{167}{}{能和我说说管理者吗？}
{168}{}{我能问些其它问题吗？}
{169}{}{谢谢你告诉我这么多。}
{170}{}{你想听谁的故事？}
{171}{}{齐默曼市长。}
{172}{}{卡勒布。}
{173}{}{麦尔斯。}
{174}{}{提恩。}
{175}{}{施密蒂。}
{176}{}{没事。}
#{177}{}{Zimmerman watches over our town. He makes sure that everyone
# gets fed, and that everybody has a job to do.}
#{178}{}{Caleb is the leader of the Regulators. It's his job to
# protect Adytum. He seems to enjoy it a litte more than he should.}
#{179}{}{Ah, our resident chemist. Miles makes bullets, and he also
# built the water distiller that makes sure we get clean
# water from the well. He's working on an underground
# farm right now, but he's missing some parts.}
#{180}{}{Tine runs the shop. It's in the bunker near the gate.
# He trades with the Hub merchants for us.}
#{181}{}{Hmm. Smitty is a tinker of sorts. He's good at repair work.
# He casts bullets and fixes broken stuff around town.}
#{182}{}{Can I ask about someone else?}
#{183}{}{Can we talk about a different subject?}
#{184}{}{}
{177}{}{齐默曼关心着我们的城市。他确保我们每个人都能自食其力。}
{178}{}{卡勒布是管理者的头儿。他负责内城区的安全。我看他对这份工作起劲过头，超过他的本分了。}
{179}{}{啊哈，我们的长驻化学师。麦尔斯制造子弹，还做出了一个水蒸馏器保证我们的井水得到净化。他现在应该在地下农场，不过她丢了些工具。}
{180}{}{提恩经营着一家商店。就在大门附近的掩体里。他替我们在哈勃城市场进行贸易。}
{181}{}{嗯，施密蒂是我们的修理工。他精于此道。他经常在城镇周围捡些子弹或者修理一些坏掉的材料。}
{182}{}{咱们聊聊其他人好吗？}
{183}{}{咱们换个话题好吗？}
{184}{}{}

#{186}{}{Are you kidding? Without computer games, you wouldn't be playing
#this, now would you?}

{186}{}{你开玩笑吧？如果真有电脑游戏，那你现在怎么不玩啊？}
