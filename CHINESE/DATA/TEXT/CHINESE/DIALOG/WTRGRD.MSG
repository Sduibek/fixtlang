# {103}{}{Hello. How are you doing?}
# {104}{}{Gahh!}
# {105}{}{Well Gahh! back to you . . . I'm sorry that you never learned
# to speak. We might have been good friends.}
# {106}{}{Ouph.}
# {107}{}{I'm not feeling very well. Someone cracked my head
# with a big pipe. I went to the medic but my head still
# hurts. Sure hope someone catches the jerk that hit me.}
# {108}{}{Why did they do that?}
# {109}{}{Guck.}
# {110}{}{Well, they attacked me while I was here pretty late one night. Usually I go
# home by eight or so, but I was staying late since someone had some water stolen and
# I was checking our supplies. Next thing I know, I wake up in the med-lab with a
# big bump on my head. Things are getting crazy around here.
# Someone is going to get killed for water soon and I don't know what
# we can do about it.}
# {111}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
# {112}{}{Sorry. I hope you feel better soon.}
# {113}{}{Here's your water.}
# {114}{}{Here's your ration for today.}
# {115}{}{Hey! What do you think you're doing?!?}
# {116}{}{Please don't take so many supplies. We need those.}
# {117}{}{You log your reports in the library computer system. You should
# return to the overseer to finalize your progress.}

# {120}{}{Hi. How have things been lately?}
# {121}{}{Say, what are you doing here?}
# {122}{}{Well, everyone's pretty nervous, of course, but we haven't had too much
# trouble. I hope you find a new chip soon.}
# {123}{}{I hand out the water rations, of course. And I make sure that nobody tries
# to take more water than their share, though I don't think we'll have any trouble.}
# {124}{}{Hmm. Well, keep up the good work.}
# {125}{}{You too. I hope you find that chip soon so we can all go back to a normal
# life.}
# {126}{}{You're welcome to take supplies if you need them, since your job is so

# {127}{}{Can I take some supplies?}

{100}{}{你看到一个负责分发水的警卫。}
{101}{}{你好，}
{102}{}{。}
{103}{}{你好，近来如何？}
{104}{}{嘎！}
{105}{}{好吧！也送你一句问候……很遗憾你从未学过怎么说话，我们本可能会成为好朋友的。}
{106}{}{哦呜。}
{107}{}{我感觉不太好。有人用根大管子打爆了我的头。我去治疗过，但我的头还是很痛。希望有人能逮到那个打我的混蛋。}
{108}{}{他们为什么那样做？}
{109}{}{咕。}
{110}{}{我是在深夜执勤的时候在这被袭击的。一般我都八点左右回家，但自从发生偷水事件后，我就会在这里多值会儿班，那时候我正在查库房。突然我就什么都不知道了，我醒来的时候在医疗室里，头上有个大包。这事情越来越疯狂，这样下去很快大概就会为水而出人命案了，我不知道我们该怎么办。}
{111}{}{我看我能做些什么。}
{112}{}{我很遗憾，我希望你很快就能好起来。}
{113}{}{这是你的水。}
{114}{}{这是你今天的定额。}
{115}{}{嘿！你在干什么！？}
{116}{}{请不要拿走太多补给，我们需要这些。}
{117}{}{你在图书馆计算机系统里更新了你的报告。现在你应该去见所长汇报一下你的进度。}

{120}{}{你好，最近怎么样？}
{121}{}{你在这儿干什么？}
{122}{}{还好，只是每个人都很紧张，当然，到目前为止还没发生什么大事。不过我仍然希望我们很快就能找到那个新的净水芯片。}
{123}{}{我在早晨按定额分配水。尽管我认为我们短时期内还不会有什么麻烦，但我还是要确保按定额分发水。}
{124}{}{嗯，继续工作吧，祝你好运。}
{125}{}{你也是，我希望你很快就能找到净水芯片，那样这里的生活就能恢复正常了。}
{126}{}{你的工作更重要，如果你需要补给就拿吧，不过别拿太多，我们剩下的不多了。}
{127}{}{我能得到一些补给吗？}

{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{我可以告诉你：Ration-定量、Rations-定量、Supplies-补给品、Water-水。}
