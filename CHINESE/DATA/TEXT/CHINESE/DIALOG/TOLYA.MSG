{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see Tolya, a desert bandit.}
{100}{}{你看见唐尼亚，一个沙漠盗匪。}
#{101}{}{Hello, I am Tolya. Looks like you just wandered in from the desert. Who are you?}
{101}{}{你好，我是唐尼亚。看起来你刚刚从沙漠游荡而来。你是谁？}
#{102}{}{I'm }
{102}{}{我是}
#{103}{}{. What do you do?}
{103}{}{。你好。}
#{104}{}{Can you tell me about your camp?}
{104}{}{能告诉我你们营地的情况吗？}
#{105}{}{Urgh?}
{105}{}{呃？}
#{106}{}{As a raider, I explore the lands in search of new supplies. There have been some towns which have been graced by our presence.}
{106}{}{作为一个强盗，我为了寻找新的补给探索大陆。有几个镇因为我们的出现变得“热闹”了。}
#{107}{}{In other words, you steal from the people you visit.}
{107}{}{换句话说，你们从你拜访的人那偷东西？}
#{108}{}{Hey, that's really great of you. I'm sure that Garl is pleased with you.}
{108}{}{嘿！你真是太棒了。我确信伽尔会对你感到高兴的。}
#{109}{}{What places have you been to?}
{109}{}{你去过哪些地方？}
#{110}{}{Come now, Garl tells me never to talk to strangers. You should at least be willing to tell me your name.}
{110}{}{来吧，伽尔告诉我不要和陌生人说话。你至少应该告诉我你的名字。}
#{111}{}{You're right. I'm }
{111}{}{你说得对，我是}
#{112}{}{. Will you tell me something about your band?}
{112}{}{。你会告诉我一些关于你们团伙的事吗？}
#{113}{}{Look you idiot, I don't have to say anything to you.}
{113}{}{看你这傻样，我没有任何事要对你说。}
#{114}{}{Go away, moron.}
{114}{}{走开，笨蛋。}
#{115}{}{We never steal. We just take the extra that others have and redistribute it among our hungry people.}
{115}{}{我们从不偷窃。我们只是拿走别人多余的东西再把它们分配给我们饿肚子的人们。}
#{116}{}{So, basically, you steal it.}
{116}{}{所以，从根本来讲，你们偷东西。}
#{117}{}{That sounds like a really great idea.}
{117}{}{那听起来真是个妙计。}
#{118}{}{I've been to many places in the wastelands. The closest places that I've been to are Shady Sands and Junktown. They are very grateful for the trips we make to them.}
{118}{}{我去过许多废土上的地方。我们去过的最近的地方是沙荫镇和迦克镇。他们因为我们去他们的地方感到非常高兴。}
#{119}{}{You visit Shady Sands?}
{119}{}{你们去沙荫镇？}
#{120}{}{Where's Junktown?}
{120}{}{迦克镇在哪？}
#{121}{}{You are starting to become annoying now. I think I will end that slight problem.}
{121}{}{你开始变得让我讨厌了。我想我应该停止这些无关紧要的谈话。}
#{122}{}{We are the Khan, and our leader is Garl. We are the most feared group in the wasteland, and with good reason. We take what we want, and those who get in our way pay the price.}
{122}{}{我们是可汗，我们的头儿是伽尔。我们有理由说我们是废土上最可怕的团伙。我们拿走想要的东西，阻挠我们的人要付出代价！}
#{123}{}{Yes, we go to Shady Sands from time to time. It adds a little excitement to the lives of everyone concerned.}
{123}{}{是的，我们定期去沙荫镇。这样也能给大家的生活带来些新鲜和刺激。}
#{124}{}{What about Junktown?}
{124}{}{迦克镇怎么样？}
#{125}{}{Why, Junktown is just a little bit to the south of here. Go a few miles, turn right at the dying cactus. You can't miss it!}
{125}{}{这有什么问的？迦克镇就在南方，近得要命。走几英里，在死仙人掌那儿向右拐。你要是走丢了才见鬼呢！}
#{126}{}{You also said you visit Shady Sands.}
{126}{}{你也说过你们去沙荫镇。}
#{127}{}{Do not bother me right now. I am preparing for the next raid.}
{127}{}{别烦我了！我要准备下一次掠夺了。}
