{119}{}{好吧，如果你这么想，我就去和罗格尔谈。}
#{120}{BUTCH05}{Uh……Rutger'll handle that. He does all the trivial stuff for the Far Go Traders. Now get on out, cause I got work to do!}
{120}{BUTCH05}{嗯……罗格尔会处理的。远行商队的所有琐事都由他做。现在出去吧，我还有事！}

{130}{BUTCH07}{你到底……你还不知道工作是什么就接受了？你小子肯定是个干活不要命的牲口。我喜欢！}
#{131}{}{Just tell me what it is, okay?}
{131}{}{告诉我是什么，好吗？}
#{132}{}{Well, you seem pretty desperate, too, so we're even.}
{132}{}{好吧，你看起来也很不要命，那么我们差不多。}
#{133}{BUTCH08}{Well, some caravans have been disappearing on us lately. Damn if anyone can figure out what happened to 'em.}
{133}{BUTCH08}{好吧。最近我们有一些商队失踪了。要有人能查出他们出了什么事就好了。}
#{134}{}{So what do you want me to do?}
{134}{}{那么你想要我干什么？}
#{135}{}{I bet you didn't even look for them.}
{135}{}{我敢打赌你都没找过他们。}
#{136}{BUTCH09}{Simple. Find out who's doing it, and tell me. Or take 'em out. It makes no damn difference to me. Just get that job done!}

{140}{BUTCH10}{不。只是普通的。}
#{141}{}{Oh come on. There has to be something I can use.}

{154}{BUTCH14}{听着，我不是害怕。我是……小心。对于死亡爪，你不小心点，你就是个蠢粪蛋子。去和贝斯谈谈，她会告诉你更多的情况。}
#{155}{}{You sound as scared as a whipped dog.}
{155}{}{你小子就像条被打怕了的癞狗。}
#{156}{}{Sorrrry. I'll go check it out.}

{162}{butch19}{嗯……你说什么？}
#{163}{}{I was implying that you were too frightened to go look for them.}
{163}{}{我意思是你给吓得够呛，都不敢出去找他们了。}
#{164}{}{Nothing. So what do you want me to do?}
{164}{}{没什么。那么你想要我做什么？}
#{165}{BUTCH20}{You know, I don't like you. But that doesn't matter. You want the job or not?}
{165}{BUTCH20}{你知道，我不喜欢你。不过那无所谓。你要不要这工作？}
#{166}{}{Sure.}
{166}{}{当然。}
#{167}{}{No thanks.}
{167}{}{不，谢了。}
#{168}{butch19}{Uh……what did you say?}

#{169}{}{You heard me.}
{169}{}{你听到了。}
#{170}{}{Nothing. So, what do you want me to do?}
{170}{}{没什么。那么你想要我做什么？}
#{171}{BUTCH22}{Yeah, yesterday! Get going!}

{186}{BUTCH28}{谢了。现在，还有别的事吗？}
#{187}{BUTCH29}{Well, you got Old Town and the Heights, but that's just houses. Downtown's got all the stores and stuff.}
{187}{BUTCH29}{好吧，这里有旧城区和高地区，高地只是说法而已，那里也只有房子。商业街有各种商店和物品。}
#{188}{}{What stores?}
{188}{}{什么商店？}
#{189}{}{Thanks.}
{189}{}{谢谢。}
#{190}{BUTCH30}{Just stuff. you wanta' see the town, go look around yourself!}
{190}{BUTCH30}{就是物品。你想看城镇，你就自己去看吧！}
#{191}{}{Uh, thanks for nothing.}
{191}{}{哦，您还真是个乐于助人的主啊，哼。}
#{192}{}{Thanks.}
{192}{}{多谢。}
#{193}{butch19}{Uh……what did you say?}
{193}{butch19}{嗯……你说什么？}
#{194}{}{Are you deaf?}

#{195}{}{Nothing. I need to ask you a few more questions, though.}
{195}{}{没什么。不过我想再问你几个问题。}
#{196}{BUTCH32}{Well, you got the Maltese Falcon, a nice place to eat, believe you me. And then……let's see, the All in One Store, the Weapons Shop……and, of course, Bob's Iguana Bits.}
{196}{BUTCH32}{好吧，有马耳他猎鹰，信不信由你，是个吃饭的好地方。还有……我想一想，百货商店，武器店……当然了，还有鲍勃的蜥蜴料理。}
#{197}{}{Thanks.}
{197}{}{多谢。}
#{198}{}{Anything else?}

#{203}{}{Thanks.}
{203}{}{多谢。}
#{204}{butch35}{Well, Necropolis is east. But uh……I wouldn't spit there if it came out gold, if ya' get my drift. Those ghouls'll eat a man's face faster than an old lady shopping at bargain day.}
{204}{butch35}{好吧，大墓地在东面。但是，嗯……听我说，就算那里可以点石成金，我也不会去那里点的。那些僵尸吃人头肉比老太太在打折商店抢购的速度还快。}
#{205}{}{Sounds like fun.}
{205}{}{听起来很有趣。}
#{206}{butch35a}{Puhh. Maybe for you! If you like that, then the Glow's down south. It's a radioactive pit.}
{206}{butch35a}{呼。那是对你！如果你喜欢，然后就是南方的闪光之地。那是个充满辐射的深坑。}
#{207}{}{Maybe I'll work on my tan.}
{207}{}{也许那里可以好好晒晒偶的皮肤呢。}

#{211}{BUTCH37}{Well, what do you have?}
{211}{BUTCH37}{好吧，你发现什么了？}
#{212}{}{Well, I found out who's taking the caravans.}
{212}{}{嗯，我查出了是谁劫走了商队。}
#{213}{}{Well, I know it wasn't the Death Claw who took the caravans.}
{213}{}{嗯，我知道劫走商队的不是死亡爪。}
#{214}{}{Nothing right now. Goodbye.}
{214}{}{现在还没有。再见。}

#{220}{}{I don't know for sure. But it's mutants, not the Death Claw.}
{220}{}{我不能确定。但肯定是变种人，不是死亡爪。}
#{221}{BUTCH40}{What, do I look a crate shy of a load? Did you even see the Death Claw?}
{221}{BUTCH40}{什么，我看起来是那种拉不了货的老爷车嘛！? 你看到死亡爪了？}
#{222}{}{Been there, saw that, killed it.}
{222}{}{我到了那儿，看到它，宰了它。}
#{223}{}{I'm telling you that it wasn't the Death Claw.}
{223}{}{我跟你说，那不是死亡爪。}
#{224}{BUTCH41}{You……you killed it? Well……I uh……um……uh, where did these mutants come from?}
{224}{BUTCH41}{你……你杀了它？好吧……我，嗯……蕖…嗯, 这些变种人是从那里来的？}
#{225}{}{I don't know yet. But they have an outpost in the mountains.}
{225}{}{我还不清楚。不过他们在山里有个前哨。}
#{226}{}{They work for The 主教. They aren't your regular mutants, either.}
{226}{}{他们为主教工作。他们也不是你想的普通的变种人。}
#{227}{BUTCH42}{An outpost? Well……um……well uh. I'll have to talk to the Committee. Yeah……yeah, they'll know what to do. Done and done. Get out, 'cause I got stuff to do……okay?}
{227}{BUTCH42}{有个前哨？好吧……嗯……好吧。我得和委员会谈一谈。是的……是的，他们会知道该怎么办。好了。出去吧，我有事要做……行吗？}

{231}{BUTCH44}{是的，好了……是的，你办得不错了！嗯，我得和委员会谈一谈。他们会知道该怎么办。现，现在出去吧！我有很多事要做……行吗？}
#{232}{BUTCH45}{What! Well……well……I'm not afraid! Rutger! I got guns! Rutger!}
{232}{BUTCH45}{什么！好吧……好吧……我不会给吓着的！罗格尔！拿我的枪来！罗格尔！}
#{233}{BUTCH46}{Alright, so it wasn't the Death Claw. But what would the mutants in Old Town want with our caravans? Unless it's some kind of conspiracy.}
{233}{BUTCH46}{好吧，那么不是死亡爪干的。但是旧城区的变种人要我们的商队干什么？除非这里面有什么阴谋。}
#{234}{}{No, no, no, you pinhead. These mutants are big and green and they have an army in the mountains to the north.}
{234}{}{不，不，不，你这蠢货。这些变种人是大个绿色的，而且他们在北边的山里有一支军队。}
#{235}{}{You really are stupid, aren't you? You're not listening!}
{235}{}{你真是蠢，不是吗？你没在听我说！}
#{236}{BUTCH47}{What? Get out! I need to tell the Committee about this. Go on, get out!}
{236}{BUTCH47}{什么？出去！我得把这个告诉委员会。快点，出去！}

#{238}{}{No, really. They're these big, green mutant guys.}
{238}{}{不，真的。他们是些大个的，绿色的变种家伙。}
#{239}{}{You're right.}
{239}{}{你是对的。}
#{240}{}{Oh come on. You think a woman like me would lie?}
{240}{}{喔，算了吧。你觉得一个像我这样的女人会撒谎？}
#{241}{BUTCH49}{I don't have time for this. Get out, and don't come back until you find something useful!}
{241}{BUTCH49}{我没时间来这些。出去，在没找到有用的东西前别回来！}
#{242}{BUTCH50}{Well then, what is it?}
{242}{BUTCH50}{那么好吧，是什么？}
#{243}{}{Actually, it IS these big mutant guys……}
{243}{}{事实上，是这些巨大的变种人……}
#{244}{}{Rats, I tell you! Big, hairy……}
{244}{}{老鼠，我跟你说！大的，有毛的……}
