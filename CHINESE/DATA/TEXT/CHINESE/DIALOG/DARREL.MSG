{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see Darrel.}
#{101}{}{You see a Paladin.}
#{102}{}{Greetings, and welcome to the Brotherhood of Steel.}
#{103}{}{Duh...}
#{104}{}{What is the Brotherhood of Steel.}
#{105}{}{Do you know where I can find a Water Chip?}
{100}{}{你看见达雷尔。}
{101}{}{你看见一名游侠。}
{102}{}{你好，欢迎来到钢铁兄弟会。}
{103}{}{哦……}
{104}{}{什么是钢铁兄弟会？}
{105}{}{你知道在哪儿能找到一块净水芯片吗？}
#{106}{}{Do you know anything about the missing caravans?}
#{107}{}{Never mind.}
#{108}{}{【Laughs at you】 Friend, I don't think you have a chance
#of getting in here. The Elders have a minimum IQ requirement
#for new Initiates.}
#{109}{}{Yes..a..well..a..No. It's just people don't even try to
#understand what we're all about.}
#{110}{}{The Brotherhood is a collective of men and women who have
#dedicated their lives to the preservation of technology.}
{106}{}{对于失踪的商队你知道些什么吗？}
{107}{}{没什么。}
{108}{}{【对着你笑】朋友，我认为你没机会进来了，元老们对于新来的人有最低限度上的智商要求。}
{109}{}{对，好吧，啊！不！其实人们甚至不去试着了解我们究竟是怎么回事。}
{110}{}{钢铁兄弟会是一群有志于保存技术知识的男女组成的团体。}
#{111}{}{I've heard that you people sacrifice puppies.}
#{112}{}{What type of armor is that your wearing.}
#{113}{}{How do I find out more about your technology.}
#{114}{}{Good bye.}
#{115}{}{No...I never even heard of one of those. One of our head
#scribes may know. Maybe you can ask one of them. That is if you join
#us.}
{111}{}{我听说你们把小动物拿来做献祭。}
{112}{}{你穿的是什么类型的装甲？}
{113}{}{我怎样才能知道你们更多的技术知识。}
{114}{}{再见！}
{115}{}{不！我从未听说过这些事，我们某个资深的研究员也许知道，如果你加入我们的话，你可以去问问他们。}
#{116}{}{Join? How do I join?}
#{118}{}{You guys don't know jack.}
#{119}{}{Sacrifice puppies!!! Where the hell did you hear that one?
#Don't believe everything you hear in the wastes they're all a bunch
#of pathetic lunatics.}
#{120}{}{Actually I thought it would have been kinda cool.}
{116}{}{加入？我如何加入？}
{118}{}{你们这些家伙什么也不知道。}
{119}{}{拿小动物献祭！！！你究竟是从哪儿听说这些的？不要相信任何你从废土上听到的任何事，那儿的人全是一群可悲的疯子。}
{120}{}{事实上我觉得这个有点酷！}
#{121}{}{Sorry to have upset you.}
#{122}{}{Everyone is a lunatic outside the Brotherhood of Steel?}
#{123}{}{The only way to know anything more about us, is to join us.
#My friend Cabbot can help you with that.}
#{125}{}{Do you have a Water Chip in the Brotherhood?.}
{121}{}{抱歉错怪了你。}
{122}{}{兄弟会以外的人都是疯子吗？}
{123}{}{想更多的了解我们的唯一途径，就是加入我们。我朋友卡波特能帮助你。}
{125}{}{在兄弟会里面有净水芯片吗？}
#{126}{}{You'll need to speak with Cabbot about that.}
#{127}{}{What is the Brotherhood of Steel all about anyway?}
#{128}{}{That's OK...It's just people don't even try to understand
#what we're all about.}
#{129}{}{What's there to understand?}
#{130}{}{Well?... I think you guys just might be a little kookie myself.}
{126}{}{关于这些你须要和卡波特谈谈。}
{127}{}{总之，兄弟会究竟是做什么的？}
{128}{}{简单的说，这仅仅是人们不去试着了解我们到底是做什么的。}
{129}{}{那儿有什么要了解的？}
{130}{}{好吧，我个人认为你们这些家伙有些奇特。}
#{131}{}{Technology. That is all that any one needs to understand.
#Join us and you will come to know this.}
#{132}{}{How does one join the Brotherhood?}
#{133}{}{You people are a little too left field for me.}
#{134}{}{I'm sorry you feel that way.}
#{135}{}{This is Powered Combat Infantry Armor model T-51b or more
#commonly know as Power Armor.}
{131}{}{技术，那是每个都须要知道的，加入我们你将会了解到这些。}
{132}{}{一般人怎样才能加入兄弟会？}
{133}{}{你们对于我来说真有点不太好理解。}
{134}{}{我很抱歉你有这样的感受。}
{135}{}{这是由动力推动的战斗步兵装甲模型T－51b，或者更通俗的说，这是动力装甲。}
#{136}{}{I've been wanderin' the wastes for weeks for weeks now and
#I've never seen armor like this before.}
#{137}{}{It looks like it would be cumbersome to wear.}
#{139}{}{The Brotherhood are the sole bearers of the Power Armor in
#the wastes. Only the honored, and Knights of the highest Stature
#are given the privilege to wear the ultimate armor.}
#{140}{}{That still doesn't answer why I've never seen it before.}
{136}{}{我在废土上游荡了一周又一周，却从未见这样的装甲。}
{137}{}{看起来穿着它挺笨重的。}
{139}{}{兄弟会是废土上动力装甲的唯一拥有者，只有被特许的，并拥有最高声望的骑士才有权穿上这套终极战甲。}
{140}{}{这仍然未解释为什么我以前从未见过它。}
#{141}{}{I would like to join.}
#{143}{}{Heathens have tried and failed to take our Power Armor from
#us. They would have to kill a Brother to possess his birthright,
#and if it comes to that, the armor would be in such poor condition
#as to render it useless.}
#{144}{}{I think I'll try to take it off your dead cold body.}
#{145}{}{Bye.}
{141}{}{一般人怎样才能加入兄弟会？}
{143}{}{一些野蛮人曾经尝试从我们这儿得到动力装甲，他们失败了。他们不得不杀了一位我们的兄弟以拥有它，如果那样的话，这套装甲将沦落到使它毫无价值的可悲境地。}
{144}{}{我想我要把它从你冰凉的尸体上扒下来。}
{145}{}{再见！}
#{146}{}{Do I have to sacrifice a puppie to join?}
#{147}{}{Cumbersome? Not in the least. The sacred armor is so finely
#constructed to such exacting specifications that it feels like an
#extension of the blessed one's own body. It increases one's strength
#many times over and helps you resist the effects of radiation so
#that you may more effectively serve the brotherhood. I would feel
#diminished without my holy armor.}
#{148}{}{How come no one else in the wastes has this armor.}
#{149}{}{I want one of those. Sign me up.}
{146}{}{我必须献祭一只小动物才能加入吗？}
{147}{}{笨重？一点儿也不！这套神圣的装甲是如此细致的按照最严格的规范制造，穿着它就好像自己身体的扩展一样，它能极大的增加使用者的力量，并能抵抗辐射的作用，这样才能更好的为兄弟会服务。没有了这神圣的装甲我就觉得变得虚弱了。}
{148}{}{怎么会废土上没有其它人有这个装甲。}
{149}{}{我想要一套。}
#{151}{}{You need to speak with Cabbot if you wish to join.}
#{152}{}{I can't believe it. They're sending him down there?}
#{153}{}{I can't believe it. They're sending her down there?}
#{154}{}{So you took the Famous Glow Quest. (Laughs)}
#{155}{}{No... I'm going to the Ancient Order.}
{151}{}{如果你想加入的话得去和卡波特谈谈。}
{152}{}{我不敢相信，他们要让他下到那儿去？}
{153}{}{我不敢相信，他们要让她下到那儿去？}
{154}{}{这么说你接受了那闪光之地的任务。【笑】}
{155}{}{不……我要去古老的建筑。}
#{156}{}{The Glow, what's that?}
#{157}{}{It's none of your business what I am doing.}
#{158}{}{Yeah, I did. Bye.}
#{159}{}{Glow, Ancient Order it's the same thing. It's still not a
#good place to visit.}
#{160}{}{Why do you say that?}
{156}{}{闪光之地，那是什么？}
{157}{}{我做什么不关你的事。}
{158}{}{是的，我做了，再见！}
{159}{}{闪光之地、古老的建筑是一回事。那可不是个观光的好地方。}
{160}{}{你为何这么说？}
#{161}{}{How hard could it be. All I have to do is go get something
#and bring it back. It's the old send the new guy on a quest thing.}
#{162}{}{Why the two names?}
#{163}{}{What's so special about this place.}
#{164}{}{The Glow, as it is known to topsiders, was supposedly a
#place where some of the most advanced weapons of that time were
#developed. At least that's what it says in the ancient writings.
#Now as fasr as any of us can tell it's a big crater filled with
#Rads. I think the Elders send Brotherhood wanabes down there
#just to get rid of them.}
#{165}{}{Others? There was others before me.}
{161}{}{这能有多难呢，我所要做的就是去那找到某样东西并把它带回来，这是老手交给新手的任务。}
{162}{}{为什么有两个名字？}
{163}{}{这地方有什么特别的吗？}
{164}{}{闪光之地，就像废土上的居民所知道的那样，可能有以前那个发达年代所制造的大部分先进武器，至少在一些古老的记录里是这么说的。而现在我们所知道的就是它是一个充满辐射的大弹坑，我认为元老们把某个兄弟会成员派到那去仅仅是为了除掉他。}
{165}{}{其它人？在我之前还有其它人。}
#{166}{}{I'm going to the Ancient Order. Where's that located.}
#{167}{}{Your right. It's not any of my business.}
#{168}{}{Well? To start it's a good 18 days travel to the Southeast
#from here. And then there's the radiation. There's a reason none
#of us have ever gone to the "Ancient Order". If you don't have
#Rad-X you'll be cooked before you even know what hit you.}
#{170}{}{Let me get this straight...}
{166}{}{我要去古老的建筑，它的位置在哪？}
{167}{}{你说的对，这不关我的事。}
{168}{}{好吧，从这儿往东南方向走大概有18天的路程，并且那儿充斥着辐射，这也是没人去过“古老建筑”的原因。如果你没有抗辐射药X的话，在你知道被什么击中之前就会变成烤蜥蜴了！}
{170}{}{我得把这个弄明白……}
#{171}{}{Most topsiders think that it is just a big Radioactive hole.
#Thus the name became the Glow or some even call it the Hot Spot.
#We in the Brotherhood know the truth. According to the ancient
#writings this place was the source of all our technology. And
#who knows what may still be there.}
#{173}{}{Let me get this straight...}
#{174}{}{Others have tried. We never heard from them again.}
#{175}{}{Hell, you've almost talked me out of even wanting to join
#the Brotherhood.}
{171}{}{大部分上层居民认为那儿仅仅是一个充满辐射的大坑，因此才称它为闪光之地，有些人甚至称它为火辣的地区。我们兄弟会的人才知道真相，通过古老的记录可知这个地方是我们所有技术知识的源泉，天知道那儿还有什么！}
{173}{}{我得把这个弄明白……}
{174}{}{有些人曾去尝试过，可我们以后再也没见过他们。}
{175}{}{该死，你们到底是兄弟会还是整人会？刚才你还想说服我加入你们。}
#{176}{}{They were weak. I'll be seen' you around.}
#{177}{}{What should I watch for when I go down there.}
#{179}{}{The Glow and the Ancient Order are one in the same.}
#{180}{}{What is the Glow?}
{176}{}{他们很差劲，我们会再见面的。}
{177}{}{当我下去的时候我该注意些什么？}
{179}{}{闪光之地和古老的建筑是一回事。}
{180}{}{闪光之地是什么？}
#{181}{}{Don't get me wrong the Brotherhood is a great place to join.
#It's by far the safest place to live in the wastes. No place else
#will you find better weapons and armor. We serve technology and
#technology serves us.}
#{182}{}{Sounds good, I'll be going on my way.}
#{183}{}{What can you tell me about the Glow.}
#{184}{}{It doesn't sound like it is worth the trouble.}
#{185}{}{What?...}
{181}{}{别误会我的意思，兄弟会是一个值得加入的伟大的地方，到目前为止它是废土上最安全的居住之地，你不会在其它地方找到比这儿更好的武器和装甲，我们服务于科技，而科技也服务于我们。}
{182}{}{听起来不错，我马上就去。}
{183}{}{关于闪光之地你能告诉我些什么。}
{184}{}{看起来不值得冒这个险。}
{185}{}{什么？……}
#{186}{}{Why does the Ancient Order have two names?}
#{187}{}{Where is the Ancient Order, and the dangers are...?}
#{188}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
#{189}{}{Most topsiders think that it is just a big Radioactive hole.
#Thus the name became the Glow or some even call it the Hot Spot.
#We in the Brotherhood know the truth. According to the ancient
#writings this place was the source of all our technology. And who
#knows what may still be there.}
#{190}{}{Got another question for you.}
{186}{}{为什么古老的建筑有两个名字？}
{187}{}{古老的建筑在哪儿？危险是……？}
{188}{}{我能问你些问题吗？}
{189}{}{大部分上层居民认为那儿仅仅是一个充满辐射的大坑，因此才称它为闪光之地，有些人甚至称它为火辣的地区。而我们兄弟会的人知道真相，通过古老的记录可知这个地方是我们所有技术知识的源泉，天知道那儿还有什么！}
{190}{}{我还有个问题问你。}
#{191}{}{Can I help you?}
#{192}{}{Never mind. Bye.}
#{193}{}{Sure ask away.}
#{194}{}{Hello}
#{195}{}{Yes, Rutger came here personally not too long ago, and that's
#not like him. He was trying to find out what had been happening to
#his caravans. I've no idea what it could have been. A few others
#say they saw something over near the hub, but it disappeared before
#they could get close enough. It's all very unnerving, I hope it's
#resolved soon.}
{191}{}{要我帮忙吗？}
{192}{}{没什么，再见。}
{193}{}{随便问吧。}
{194}{}{你好。}
{195}{}{是的，不久前罗格尔亲自来到这儿，这可不像他的作风！他想查出他的商队究竟发生了什么事情。我不知道究竟是什么回事，有几个家伙说他们在哈勃城附近看见一些东西，但是在他们靠近之前就消失了。这一切都非同寻常，我希望这个疑团能很快解开。}
#{196}{}{I heard you make animal sacrifices! Maybe you take these
#caravans for your dark rituals!}
#{197}{}{Any suspicions?}
#{198}{}{Well, if you see anything let me know. I'd like to get to the
#bottom of this soon myself.}
#{199}{}{Not really, but I suspect it's foul play... but then again,
#there are a lot of strange and dangerous creatures out there in the
#wastelands. It could simply be some creature, or more likely a
#herd or band of them. I hope that helps. Good day.}
{196}{}{我听说你们用动物来献祭！也许你把商队抓来做黑暗的仪式了。}
{197}{}{有什么疑点吗？}
{198}{}{那么，如果你知道什么请告诉我，我不久就要独自下到它的底部去了。}
{199}{}{其实不是这样，我猜这是不公平的竞赛……但是再一次地，废土上有很多陌生并且危险的生物，可能仅仅是一些生物，或者是牧群，或是二者的结合。我希望这有些用，祝你愉快！}

#{209}{}{If you were lookin' to get a hold of some better arms,
#maybe you should try the Glow down south. 【Darrel points south】}
#{210}{}{Here take some Rad-X. 【Darrel gives you some pills】}
#{211}{}{Swallow these like this. 【Darrel motions taking the
#pills and rubs his tummy】. Mmmmm yummm.}
#{212}{}{Wait, wait, Not yet! 【Darrel stops you from taking the pills】
#Wait until you get to the Glow.}
#{300}{}{【more】}
{209}{}{如果你想得到更好武器装置，也许你该去南边的闪光之地试试。【达雷尔指向南方】}
{210}{}{拿着这些抗辐射药X。【达雷尔给你一些药丸】}
{211}{}{像这样吞下去。【达雷尔拿着药丸比着手势，还揉着他的肚子】。阿呜阿呜阿呜……}
{212}{}{等等，不是现在，【达雷尔阻止你吞下药丸】等你到了闪光之地再吃！}
