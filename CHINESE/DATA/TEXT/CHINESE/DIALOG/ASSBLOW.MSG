{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{Kalnor, a Junktown guard.}
{100}{}{卡尔诺，一个迦克镇的守卫。}

#{101}{}{You'd better watch yourself here.}
{101}{}{你在这里最好注意点。}

#{102}{}{This isn't a good town to get in trouble in.}
{102}{}{这可不是一个能让你到处惹麻烦的地方。}

#{103}{}{Behave, and we won't have to get nasty.}
{103}{}{规矩点，这样我也不用来硬的了。}

#{104}{}{You're OK.}
{104}{}{你没什么问题。}

#{105}{}{Keep up the good work.}
{105}{}{做得不错，继续这样。}

#{106}{}{Nice day, isn't it?}
{106}{}{不错的一天，不是吗？}

#{107}{}{This is Junktown. Nice place to live, as long as you stay on
# our good side.}
{107}{}{这里是迦克镇。落脚的好地方，只要你别干坏事。}

#{108}{}{Watch out for Gizmo and his cronies.}
{108}{}{小心吉斯莫和他的走狗。}

#{109}{}{I like my boss.}
{109}{}{我喜欢我的老大。}

#{110}{}{You'd better put that away. Junktown is a friendly place, friend, and we
# want to keep it that way.}
{110}{}{你最好把那东西收起来。迦克镇是一个友好的地方，朋友，并且我们想保持如此。}

#{111}{}{Put what away?}
{111}{}{把什么收起来？}

#{112}{}{Don't tell me what to do, loser boy.}
{112}{}{不用你来告诉我怎么做，白痴。}

#{113}{}{Sounds fair. By the way, what is the local law regarding weapons?}
{113}{}{听起来不错。顺便问一下，本地对于武器是如何规定的？}

#{114}{}{Uh, oh.}
{114}{}{嗯，哦。}

#{115}{}{Your weapon, idiot. Killian won't take your arms away, but you'd
# better damn well keep them in your holster.}
{115}{}{你的武器，呆瓜。基利安不会把你的武器没收，但是你最好把这些武器在皮套上收好。}

#{116}{}{Oh, sorry.}
{116}{}{哦，对不起。}

#{117}{}{No way! I'm not putting down my shooters for nobody!}
{117}{}{不行！我不会为谁收起我的枪！}

#{118}{}{You'd better behave, since it's the law, and I enforce the law.
# Put your weapon away. Don't draw it unless in self-defense and
# you won't have a problem with us guards. Disobey the law and we
# will return you to the lawless wasteland--dead or alive.}
{118}{}{你最好规矩点，既然这里有法律，并且我执法。把你的武器收起来。除非你要自卫，不然不要拿出你的武器，这样你就不会与我们守卫有什么麻烦。不服从法律的，我们会送你回到无法律的废土上――无论生死。}

#{119}{}{Sure, since you put it that way.}
{119}{}{既然你这么说，那好吧。}

#{120}{}{Bite your laws!}
{120}{}{你的法律去死吧！}

#{121}{}{Well, uh, fine with me. But you'd better be careful.}
{121}{}{嗯，对于我无妨。不过你最好小心点。}

#{122}{}{Good you asked. No weapons can be drawn except in self-defense. If
# you start a fight, it's your fault. Other than that, it's your right
# to go around armed. Just don't pull a knife or gun without just
# cause. Have a good day.}
{122}{}{问得好了。除非是自卫，否则不允许亮出武器。如果是你挑起的打斗，那是你的错。除此之外，你有权利带着武器。只要别在无正当理由的情况下把刀或枪拿出来。}

#{123}{}{Hey you, no weapons! And I don't care if your momma dropped you on
# your head as a kid. No weapons.}
{123}{}{嘿，你，不准拿出武器！我不管是不是你小时候你老妈把你头朝地摔到地上过。不准亮出武器。}

#{124}{}{Hey! You! What are you doing sneaking around?}
{124}{}{嘿！你！你在附近偷偷摸摸的干什么？}

#{125}{}{Nothing.}
{125}{}{没什么。}

#{126}{}{I'm not sneaking around. I just like to walk cautiously.}
{126}{}{我没有偷偷摸摸。我只是小心地走路而已。}

#{127}{}{Uhhh.}
{127}{}{呃。 }

#{128}{}{Whatever you're doing, don't do it in this town.}
{128}{}{不管你在做什么，别在城里这么干。}

#{129}{}{Hey! No shady characters in town! Get out of here before we throw you out!}
{129}{}{嘿！名声不好的人不准进城！在我们赶你出去前滚出去。}

#{130}{}{Well, uh, OK. Whatever. Just don't do anything out of line.}
{130}{}{嗯，好吧。随便你。只要别干什么越轨行为。}

#{131}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{131}{}{谢谢，再见。 }

#{132}{}{Certainly. I will throw caution to the wind, sir.}
{132}{}{当然。我以后不会再警告你的，先生。}

#{133}{}{Certainly. I will throw caution to the wind, ma'am.}
{133}{}{当然。我以后不会再警告你的，女士。}

#{134}{}{You'd better watch your step around here, because we'll be watching you.}
{134}{}{你在这里最好注意你的言行，因为我会盯着你的。}

#{135}{}{Welcome to Junktown. What can I do for you?}
{135}{}{欢迎来到迦克镇。我有什么能帮你吗？}

#{136}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{136}{}{没什么，谢谢。}

#{137}{}{What are you doing here? What is this place?}
{137}{}{你在这里做什么？这里是什么地方？}

#{138}{}{Where can I get some supplies?}
{138}{}{我在哪里能获得补给？}

#{139}{}{Wa-wa!}
{139}{}{哇―哇！}

#{140}{}{I dunno about that. You might want to check with Killian.
# He's to the north. That's up that way, OK?}
{140}{}{我不知道。你可以去找基利安问问。他就在北面一点。就是这条路，清楚了吗？}

#{141}{}{What does it look like? I'm a guard, and I'm keeping an eye out for
# strangers like you. And this place is called Junktown. Hey, don't laugh.
# I happen to like the name myself. We mostly do trading. Sometimes we trade
# with those stuck up bastards from Hub. Hey, you're not from the Hub are you?}
{141}{}{我看起来像什么？我是一个守卫，而且我就是专门留意你这类外人的。这里是一个叫迦克镇的地方。嘿，别笑。我恰好喜欢这个名字。我们主要是做贸易的。有些时候我们和从哈勃城来的那些混蛋商人交易。嘿，你不是从哈勃城来的吧？}

#{142}{}{What? The Hub? Sure I am!}
{142}{}{什么？哈勃城？我当然是！}

#{143}{}{Me? No, I'm not from the Hub.}
{143}{}{我？不，我不是来自哈勃城的。}

#{144}{}{Then you must know most of the rules. Have a good day. And I am sorry
# about the bastards part, OK?}
{144}{}{那么你一定知道大部分的规矩。祝你日安。还有，抱歉我之前说的那些不客气的部分。}

#{145}{}{Yeah! Hey, no problem. Bye.}
{145}{}{嗯！嘿，没关系。再见。}

#{146}{}{It's going to cause me some severe mental trauma. Later.}
{146}{}{这会给我造成严重的心理创伤。我走了。}

#{147}{}{Hmmm. OK. It's not our place to ask questions. Have a good day and
# don't make any trouble.}
{147}{}{嗯。好吧。这里不是我们提问的地方。祝你日安。别惹麻烦。}

#{148}{}{Oh, heck. The place for that is Darkwater's. Killian runs it.
# It's a little to the north. Killian has the best supplies in town.}
{148}{}{哦，H。那有叫黑水的地方。基利安开的。往北一点。基利安有全镇最好的补给。}

#{149}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{149}{}{谢谢。再见。}

#{150}{}{You wanna show me where you keep "your" supplies?}
{150}{}{你想给我看看你存放“你的”补给的地方吗？}

#{152}{}{Uh, no. Sorry, lady. I got work to do here.}
{152}{}{呃，不。抱歉，小姐。我在这里还有工作要做。}

#{153}{}{Have a nice day.}
{153}{}{愿你有个美好的一天。}

#{154}{}{Keep out of trouble.}
{154}{}{别惹麻烦。}

#{155}{}{Boy, I sure hope my replacement gets here soon. It feels like
# I've been standing guard duty forever.}
{155}{}{小子，我当然希望我能尽快换岗。我感觉我似乎要在这里永远站岗下去。}

#{156}{}{I'm sorry, the gates are closed for the night. Come back in the morning.}
{156}{}{我很抱歉，晚上不允许进入。早上再来吧。}

#{157}{}{Hey, I need to get in!}
{157}{}{嘿，我需要进来！}

#{158}{}{No problem. See you in the morning.}
{158}{}{没问题。早上见。}

#{159}{}{I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but I would like to enter your town.
# You can see that I would cause no harm.}
{159}{}{我很抱歉打扰了你，先生，不过我想进城。你也看得出我不会出什么问题的。}

#{160}{}{Hunh-huh!}
{160}{}{哼-哼！}

#{161}{}{Come . . . back . . . day . . .}
{161}{}{白天……再……来……}

#{162}{}{Sorry, the rules are the rules. No strangers admitted during the night.}
{162}{}{抱歉，规定就是规定。陌生人不允许晚间进来。}

#{163}{}{Well, I shouldn't do this, but you seem like a nice enough person.
# Come on in, but don't make any trouble.}
{163}{}{嗯，我不应该这么做，不过你似乎是个不错的人。进来吧，不过别惹任何麻烦。}

#{164}{}{Hey! It's you! Come on in, }
{164}{}{嘿！是你！进来吧，}

#{165}{}{. Good to see you again!}
{165}{}{。很高兴能再见到你。}

#{166}{}{Hey, you'd better turn right around and walk back out of here.}
{166}{}{嘿，你最好掉头退回去。}

#{167}{}{Go on in.}
{167}{}{进来吧。}
