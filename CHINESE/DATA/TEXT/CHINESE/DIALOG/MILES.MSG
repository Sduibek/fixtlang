{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{You see Miles, the chemist of Adytum.}
{100}{}{你看到麦尔斯，内城区的化学师。}
#{101}{}{You see a thin man in a white smock.}
{101}{}{你看到一个装着白色工作服的瘦小男人。}
#{102}{}{I don't believe we've met. I'm Miles. What can I do for you?}
{102}{}{我不认为我们以前见过面。我是麦尔斯。能帮你什么忙？}
#{103}{}{I'm just looking around, thanks.}
{103}{}{我随便转转，多谢。}
#{104}{}{That smock makes you look like a scientist. What are you studying?}
{104}{}{这工作服让你看起来像个科学家。你在研究什么？}
#{105}{}{Huh?}
{105}{}{哈?}
#{106}{}{Well, enjoy your stay in our little town.}
{106}{}{好吧，希望你在我们小镇过得愉快。}
#{107}{}{I'm a chemist. Mostly, I make primer and powder so that we can re-use
# the brass casings from bullets. But I also dabble with some other chemicals.}
{107}{}{我是化学师。多数时候，我做雷管和火药。这样我们就能重新利用子弹壳。不过我也涉及一些别的化学药品。}
#{108}{}{So you make bullets for Adytum.}
{108}{}{这么说来，你替内城区制造子弹。}
#{109}{}{Where do you get the sulfur, potassium nitrate, and other chemicals?}
{109}{}{你从哪弄硫磺，硝酸钾和其他的化学制品？}
#{110}{}{What other chemicals do you work with?}
{110}{}{你还做些什么化学药品？}
#{111}{}{Thanks for the information.}
{111}{}{多谢你提供的信息。}
#{112}{}{Yes, although Smitty is the one who actually casts the bullets.
# I just refill the brass casings.}
{112}{}{是，虽然实际上是施密蒂在造弹头。我只是给弹壳内充填火药。}
#{113}{}{But the Hub merchants make a profit off of you and the town.}
{113}{}{不过哈勃城商人们利用你和这个镇子来赚钱。}
#{114}{}{It's unusual to find someone who can appreciate chemistry!
# But to answer your question, some of the materials we get from Hub merchants;
# others I manufacture or just find in the area. For instance, the dung heaps
# from the Brahmin are a good source, as well as some of the strains of fungus
# that I cultivate.}
{114}{}{士为知己者死，女为悦己者容！找到个真正懂化学的可真不容易！好，回答你的问题，有些材料来自哈勃城商人；其他的，我自己做或者就地取材。例如，双头牛的粪堆是个不错的来源，和我自己培养的一些真菌一样好用。}
#{115}{}{Well, I've been trying to get some strong acids so that Smitty can use
# them for etching. I also have been trying to make some permanent dyes and inks.
# But without access to natural inks, it's difficult.}
{115}{}{嗯，我在试做一些强酸给施密蒂做蚀刻。我还试着制作一些持久的染料和墨水。不过没有自然的墨水，这很难做。}
#{116}{}{Any time.}
{116}{}{随时。}
#{117}{}{Oh dear. I'm afraid I can't help you.}
{117}{}{哦，天啊。恐怕我帮不了你。}
#{118}{}{Hello again. Can I help you?}
{118}{}{再次欢迎。能帮上什么忙吗？}
#{119}{}{Yes, well, we have to make a living. Since the hydroponic farms aren't
# functioning, we have to buy food from the merchants, and bullets are the only
# thing we have to sell.}
{119}{}{是的，你看，我们必须生存下去。自从水栽培农场无法开工，我们不得不从商人那买食物，子弹是我们唯一能卖的。}
#{120}{}{I could try to get the parts to fix the hydroponic farms.}
{120}{}{我可以试着找找修复水栽培农场的部件。}
#{121}{}{Oh. Well, that's too bad.}
{121}{}{哦。你看，那太糟糕了。}
#{122}{}{Really? That would be wonderful! We're just missing a few parts, but
# I'm sure that  if you could scrounge up the right pieces, we could be
# self-sufficient! Sammael might be able to give you some help.}
{122}{}{真的吗？那太好了！我们就是差了那些部件，不过我肯定如果你找到合适的部件，我们就能够自给自足。山谬会告诉你更多。}
#{123}{}{Have you found the parts yet?}
{123}{}{你找到部件了吗？}
#{124}{}{Yes, here they are.}
{124}{}{是的，这些就是。}
#{125}{}{Not yet, who did you say I should ask about them?}
{125}{}{还没，你刚才说我要找谁问关于这些部件的事情？}
#{126}{}{You'll need to talk to Sammael. You'll usually find him in
# a tent down by the farms during the day.}
{126}{}{你应该和山谬谈谈。一般白天的时候到农场附近的帐篷里可以找到他。}
#{127}{}{【Miles looks over the parts】 Those are them, but it looks like
# Smitty is going to have to do a little work on them.
# Can you take them over to him?}
{127}{}{【麦尔斯看着部件】是它们，不过看来施密蒂要对它们做些加工。你能把它们给他送过去吗？}
#{128}{}{I've got other things to deal with.  Can you do it yourself?}
{128}{}{我有别的事要处理。你能自己做这事吗？}
#{129}{}{Sure, I'll be back after he's fixed them.}
{129}{}{好，他修好后我会再来。}
#{130}{}{Sure, I appreciate you finding them for us.}
{130}{}{好，非常感谢你替我们找到它们。}
#{131}{}{And . . .}
{131}{}{还有……}
#{132}{}{Not a problem.}
{132}{}{没问题。}
#{133}{}{Oh. I almost forgot. Here is some stuff, for your trouble.
# 【Miles hands you some caps and some stimpacks.】}
{133}{}{哦。我差点忘了。东西在这，麻烦你了。【麦尔斯递给你一些钱和治疗针。】}
#{134}{}{Were you able to take the parts over to Smitty?}
{134}{}{你能把这些部件带给施密蒂吗？}
#{135}{}{【Miles takes the fixed parts from you】 Looks like Smitty did a great job on
# these. Thanks for the help, and here's some stuff for your trouble.}
{135}{}{【麦尔斯从你这拿走修好的部件】看起来施密蒂干得不错。多谢你的帮忙，这里有些东西聊表谢意。}
#{136}{}{【Miles hands you some caps and some stimpacks.】}
{136}{}{【麦尔斯递给你一些钱和治疗针。】}
#{137}{}{If you ever get back this way, you might want to look me and Smitty up.
# We might be able to help you out with some adjustments to some of your equipment.
# Smitty can work wonders with certain weapons, and I can help out with
# certain sorts of armor.}
{137}{}{无论什么时候你再到这来，来找我和施密蒂。我们可以帮你校调装备。施密蒂对某些武器很在行，我可以处理某些装甲。}
#{138}{}{Looks like you found some Power Armor. I've heard of a chemical process
# that I could use to harden the surface of the armor. However, I'm missing some
# information which could give me the last few clues to the formula and
# reagents necessary.  I've heard the Librarian in the Hub, Mrs. Stapleton,
# has some journals and books that might be of use.
# If you could get those from there, I could probably test the process
# on your armor.}
{138}{}{看来你找到动力装甲了。我知道一种化学处理可以强化装甲表面。不过，我丢了些资料，这些资料是一些有关化学公式和试剂的提示。我听说哈勃城的图书管理员，斯塔布雷顿夫人，有些学术期刊和专业书籍可能有用。如果你能拿，我会在你的装甲上试试这种化学强化处理。}
#{139}{}{Sounds good. I'll go talk to Mrs. Stapleton.}
{139}{}{听起来不错。我去和斯塔布雷顿夫人谈谈。}
#{140}{}{I got better things to do then fetch something else for you.}
{140}{}{我有更好的事情要做然后再替你弄些别的东西。}
#{141}{}{Well, if you ever change your mind, just go see Mrs. Stapleton
# and then head on back here.}
{141}{}{好吧，如果你改变想法了，就去看看斯塔布雷顿夫人，再回到这里。}
#{142}{}{Had a chance to get to the Hub yet and visit Mrs. Stapleton?}
{142}{}{找到时间去哈勃城拜访一下斯塔布雷顿夫人了吗？}
#{143}{}{Yeah, here are the books.}
{143}{}{嗯，就是这些书。}
#{144}{}{Not yet.}
{144}{}{还没。}
#{145}{}{【Miles takes the books from you, and starts flipping through them.】 Hmmmm.
# Yes, hmmmm. 【He mumbles to himself for a few more minutes.】
# Well, I think I can figure it out, but it will take a full day
# for the bonding to occur. Is that acceptable?}
{145}{}{【麦尔斯拿走了书，开始翻看。】嗯。对，嗯。【他自言自语的嘀咕了一阵】好，我想我搞明白了，不过要花一整天才能处理完。可以接受吧？}
#{146}{}{Not a problem.}
{146}{}{没问题。}
#{147}{}{Sorry, don't have the time.}
{147}{}{抱歉，没时间等了。}
#{148}{}{Well, when you have the time, come back and I'll do the process
# on your armor.}
{148}{}{好，等你有时间了，再回来我会替你处理装甲。}
#{149}{}{【Miles takes your armor from you.】}
{149}{}{【麦尔斯拿走了装甲。】}
#{150}{}{【Miles hands your armor back to you, it seems to glint a
# little more than it did before.】 Well, I think it worked! Hope it helps you out.}
{150}{}{【麦尔斯把装甲还给了你，它看起来比以前更加闪亮。】好，我想这种化学强化方法成功了！希望它能给你些帮助。}
#{151}{}{What happened to your power armor? I can only help you out
# if you have power armor.}
{151}{}{你的能量装甲怎么了？你有了能量装甲我才能帮得了你。}
#{152}{}{Nice to see you, but I'm right in the middle of some research.}
{152}{}{很高兴看到你，不过我还在研究。}
#{153}{}{Nothing I can do with that type of armor. Sorry.}
{153}{}{对这种装甲我无能为力。抱歉。}
