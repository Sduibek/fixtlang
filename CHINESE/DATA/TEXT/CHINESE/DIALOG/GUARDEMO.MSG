{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

#{100}{}{A Junktown guard.}
{100}{}{一个迦克镇卫兵。}
#{101}{}{This is Junktown. Nice place to live, as long as you stay on our good side}
{101}{}{这里是迦克镇。如果你规矩点，这里就是一个很好的地方。}
#{102}{}{Watch out for Gizmo and his cronies.}
{102}{}{小心吉斯莫和他的人。}
#{103}{}{I like my boss.}
{103}{}{我喜欢我的老板。}
#{104}{}{You'd better put that away. Junktown is a friendly place, friend, and we want to keep it that way.}
{104}{}{你最好把那个收起来。迦克镇是一个和平的地方，而且我们想这样继续下去。}
#{105}{}{Put what away?}
{105}{}{把什么收起来？}
#{106}{}{Don't tell me what to do, loser boy.}
{106}{}{别让我动手，白痴。}
#{107}{}{Sounds fair. By the way, what is the local law regarding weapons?}
{107}{}{听起来挺合理。顺便问问，这儿关于武器的法律是什么？}
#{108}{}{Uh oh.}
{108}{}{呃 哦。}
#{109}{}{Your weapon, idiot. Killian won't take your arms away, but you'd better damn well keep them in your holster.}
{109}{}{你的武器，白痴。基利安不会缴你的械，但是你最好把你的枪乖乖地收起来。}
#{110}{}{Oh, sorry.}
{110}{}{哦，对不起。}
#{111}{}{No way! I'm not putting down my shooters for nobody!}
{111}{}{没门！任何人都休想让我放下我的枪！}
#{112}{}{You'd better behave, since it's the law, and I enforce the law. Put your weapon away, don't draw it unless in self-defense, and you won't have a problem with us guards.}
{112}{}{你最好这么做，因为这就是法律，而且我维护着法律。把你的武器收起来，除了自卫别碰它们，何况有我们在，你是不会有麻烦的。}
#{113}{}{【more】}
{113}{}{【更多】}
#{114}{}{Disobey the law, and we will return you to the lawless wasteland - dead or alive.}
{114}{}{违犯法律的话，我们就把你扔到没有法律的废土上去。是死是活你自己看着办。}
#{115}{}{Sure, since you put it that way.}
{115}{}{你既然这么说，好吧。}
#{116}{}{Bite your laws!}
{116}{}{滚你娘的法律！}
#{117}{}{Well, uh, fine with me. But you'd better be careful.}
{117}{}{好吧，呃，我同意。但是你最好小心点。}
#{118}{}{Fine, then. Heh.}
{118}{}{那好。呵。}
#{119}{}{Good you asked. No weapons can be drawn except in self-defense. If you start a fight, it's your fault. Other than that, it's your ight to go around armed. Just don't pull a knife or gun without just cause. Have a good day.}
{119}{}{问得好。除了自卫不准动用武器。如果是你先找茬，那就是你的责任。如果情况相反，反击是你的权力。没有正当理由就别碰你的刀和枪。祝你一天愉快。}
#{120}{}{Thanks - you, too.}
{120}{}{谢谢你。}
#{121}{}{Hey you, no weapons! And I don't care if your momma dropped you on your head as a kid. No weapons.}
{121}{}{嘿，你！收起武器！我不管你妈会不会像教训小孩一样敲你的脑袋。收起你的武器！}
#{122}{}{Dorf!}
{122}{}{呸!}
#{123}{}{You earn 150 experience points for killing the guard.}
{123}{}{因为杀死卫兵你得到150点经验值。}
