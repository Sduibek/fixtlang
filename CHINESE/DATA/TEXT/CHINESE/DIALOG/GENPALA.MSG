{1199}{}{此人不能告诉你什么。}

# {100}{}{You see a Paladin.}
# {101}{}{Sorry, can't talk, Initiate.}
# {102}{}{Good day.}
# {103}{}{Did you know you could survive for weeks without water in a suit
# of powered armor?}
# {104}{}{Don't you just love a good fight?}
# {105}{}{I really like the new laser rifles, but the old laser pistols
# are my favorite.}
# {106}{}{The night perimeter patrols are very dangerous. I wouldn't wander
# too far at night if I were you.}
# {107}{}{Be careful, it's a deadly world out there.}
# {108}{}{I think my armor has a spot on it!}
# {109}{}{The Brotherhood is great. I haven't had any experience
# outside of it, but it couldn't possibly get better than this.}
# {110}{}{Good day, Initiate.}
# {111}{}{If you need anything, you should talk to Vree.}
# {112}{}{Vree's right over there if you need to talk to someone.}
# {113}{}{I've got to find time between the patrols and training to keep up
# with my studies. I think I'm getting a little rusty.}
# {114}{}{You've got to keep your mind and body in top condition at all times,
# Initiate.}
# {115}{}{Being a Paladin isn't just combat, my son.}
# {116}{}{Being a Paladin isn't just combat, my lady.}


{100}{}{你看见了一名游侠。}
{101}{}{对不起，我是个新兵，不能与外人谈话。}
{102}{}{天气不错啊。}
{103}{}{你知道吗，穿上了能量装甲的话，就是不喝水，活几个礼拜也是没问题的。}
{104}{}{你觉不觉得酣畅淋漓的战斗是种享受？}
{105}{}{我确实喜欢这把新的镭射步枪，但是我的最爱还是原来的镭射手枪。}
{106}{}{晚上时候巡逻区以外都是很危险的，因此我建议你最好老实呆着。}
{107}{}{小心点，外边很危险。}
{108}{}{我的护甲好像脏了。}
{109}{}{兄弟会真是太棒了，尽管我从没去过别的地方，也知道没有哪里比这更好。}
{110}{}{天气真好，小兄弟。}
{111}{}{有什么需要就去找弗蕾。}
{112}{}{你要是想要聊天的话弗蕾就在那等着呢。}
{113}{}{我得想办法在巡逻和训练之间挤出点时间来保持学习进度。我想我已经有点生疏了。}
{114}{}{你要时刻保证自己处于最佳状态，新兵。}
{115}{}{做个游侠可不只是打打杀杀，小伙子。}
{116}{}{做个游侠可不只是打打杀杀，小姐。}
