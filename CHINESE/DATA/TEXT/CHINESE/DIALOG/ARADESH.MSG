#{100}{}{You see Aradesh.}
{100}{}{你看见亚拉德什。}

#{101}{Ara_1g}{Greetings, wanderer. Please do not be offended if the
#gentlefolk about seem rude. As Dharma said, 'Tough
#times tan the human hide.' Your business in Shady
#Sands might be?}
{101}{Ara_1g}{你好，旅行者。这里的居民们或许有点粗鲁，但不要生气。达玛说：“乱世能让人坚强。”你来沙荫镇有何贵干？}

#{102}{Ara_1n}{Greetings. Your business in Shady Sands might be?}
{102}{Ara_1n}{你好。你来沙荫镇有何贵干？}

#{103}{Ara_1b}{We don't take to strangers much. Your business in
#Shady Sands?}
{103}{Ara_1b}{我们这里很少有外来者。你来沙荫镇有何贵干？}

#{104}{}{I'm from a small village west of here. I'm just
#exploring and mean you no harm.}
{104}{}{我从西面的一个小村子来。我只是在探险，没有恶意。}

#{105}{}{What's it to you?}
{105}{}{关你什么事？}

#{106}{}{My reasons are mine to keep.}
{106}{}{我保留我的理由。}

#{107}{}{I'm from a Vault to the west. My people are dying
#of thirst and I need to find a water purifier chip
#for them to survive.}
{107}{}{我从西面的一个避难所来。我的人正受到颗缺水渴死的危险，我要找一个净水芯片让他们能活下去。}

#{108}{}{I'm saving an entire people from destruction!}
{108}{}{我正在救民于水火！}

#{109}{}{Shady Sands? Whoops, I'm lost! I'll just be going now.}
{109}{}{沙荫镇？哎呀，我迷路了！我得走了。}

#{110}{}{Hunh?}
{110}{}{哈？}

#{111}{Ara_2}{I know of no village to the west.}
{111}{Ara_2}{据我所知西面没有村子。}

#{112}{}{Have you been through the mountains west of here?}
{112}{}{你翻过这里西面的山吗？}

#{113}{}{So?}
{113}{}{那么？}

#{114}{}{Are you saying you know every location from here
#to the ocean?}
{114}{}{你的意思是，你了解从这里到海洋的每个地方？}

#{115}{}{I'm sure you've been many places, but you must have
#missed my tiny village.}
{115}{}{我相信你到过很多地方，不过你一定遗漏了我在的小村庄。}

#{116}{Ara_3}{Ah well, to my regret, I have not. Which begs the question,
#how did you make that passage?}
{116}{Ara_3}{哦，那么，很遗憾，我没有。那么让我重复一次我的问题，你是怎么到这里的？}

#{117}{}{It was pretty tough, but I made it.}
{117}{}{很辛苦，不过我还是走过来了。}

#{118}{}{What's it to you?}
{118}{}{与你何干？}

#{119}{}{Look, all I wanted was a few supplies and things,
#but I will gladly go elsewhere.}
{119}{}{听着，我想要的只是一些补给和其它东西，不过我也不是非要在你们这里搞到这些。}

#{120}{}{I don't need to answer you.}
{120}{}{我不需要回答你。}

#{121}{Ara_4}{Yes, hmmm, yes, yes. yes. I shall believe you...for now.
#But we do not trust easily, especially those who might be dangerous.
#Know that Seth and I will be watching you.}
{121}{Ara_4}{好的，嗯，对，对，对。我应该相信你……目下而言。不过我们不会轻易信任别人，特别是对于那些可能是危险分子的人。你要明白，塞思和我会盯着你的一举一动。}

#{122}{Ara_5}{It is my town, wanderer. You must answer my questions
#or leave. This is not a matter of choice.}
{122}{Ara_5}{这是我的城镇，旅行者，你要么回答我的问题要么离开这里。这里没你选择的余地。}

#{123}{}{I don't have to tell you anything.}
{123}{}{我不必告诉你任何事情。}

#{124}{}{I mean you no harm, really.}
{124}{}{我对你没有恶意，真的。}

#{125}{}{Don't worry, I'm leaving.}
{125}{}{别担心，我就走。}

#{126}{Ara_6}{You are quite insolent. I believe you should leave. Do
#not return. You will not be welcome.}
{126}{Ara_6}{你相当无礼。我想你应该离开。别回来。你不会受欢迎的。}

#{127}{Ara_7}{So be it, wanderer. Seth will show you out.}
{127}{Ara_7}{随你，旅行者。塞思会请你出去的。}

#{128}{Ara_8}{You must think me quite gullible, wanderer. You
#conquered the mountains by yourself?}
{128}{Ara_8}{你以为我很好骗吗，旅行者。你一个人翻过了那些山脉？}

#{129}{}{Doesn't matter how I think. It's true I came
#from the mountains.}
{129}{}{我怎么想不重要。我从那些山脉翻过来是事实。}

#{130}{}{No, just stupid.}
{130}{}{不，仅仅是愚蠢而已。}

#{131}{Ara_9}{As Dharma said, 'Caution is life in troubled times.'
#Your origin is not the issue. Your intent is.}
{131}{Ara_9}{如达玛所说，“小心驶得万年船”，你从哪里来并不是问题。重要的是你来此地的用意。}

#{132}{}{Okay.}
{132}{}{好吧。}

#{133}{Ara_9A}{I will let you pass, but know this: Seth and I will
#watch you very, very closely. Do not even consider
#bringing trouble here.}
{133}{Ara_9A}{我就不再盘问你了，不过你要记住：塞思和我会很小心、很小心地盯着你的。如果想在这里惹麻烦，你还是省省吧。}

#{134}{Ara_10}{And keep them you may. But this is not a city of
#open hospitality. If you desire that, go to Junktown.
#You may enter, but know we have our eyes on you.}
{134}{Ara_10}{你可以不说。不过这里不是一个公开好客的地方。如果你想的话，去迦克镇。你可以进得我们的镇子，不过你要知道，我们会盯着你的。}

#{135}{Ara_11}{A Vault. How shall I trust you, wanderer, when you
#are not honest with me?}
{135}{Ara_11}{一个避难所？我怎么能相信你呢，旅行者，你说的不是实话吧？}

#{136}{}{No, honestly, I come from a Vault!}
{136}{}{实际上，我从一个避难所来的！}

#{137}{}{The Vault is . . . the name of my village.}
{137}{}{这“避难所”是……是我村子的名称。}

#{138}{}{You're right, I was lying.}
{138}{}{你说对了，我是在撒谎。}

#{139}{Ara_12}{Hmmm, yes, yes, yes. Then tell me of this Vault.}
{139}{Ara_12}{嗯，对对对。那么就给说说这个避难所。}

#{140}{}{Well . . . the Vault is actually the name of my town.
#We name it that because it's in between two big cliffs.}
{140}{}{呃……避难所其实就是我在城镇的名称。我们取这个名字是因为它在两个大峭壁的中间。}

#{141}{}{It's a big place built into a mountain far to the west.
#My people have been there for the last 80 years.}
{141}{}{那是一个建在遥远西面的一座山中的一个很大的地方。我的人民已经在那里居住了80年了。}

#{142}{}{Why do you want to know?}
{142}{}{你为什么想知道？}

#{143}{Ara_13}{Wanderer, I shall believe you . . . for now. You may
#enter Shady Sands, but be warned your every move will be watched.}
{143}{Ara_13}{旅行者，我可以相信你……只是现在。你可以进入沙荫镇，不过我告诫你，你的所有举动都会被注意。}

#{144}{Ara_14}{I will not be lied to, wanderer.}
{144}{Ara_14}{不要对我撒慌，旅行者。}

#{145}{}{I don't have to tell you anything.}
{145}{}{我不需要告诉你任何事。}

#{146}{}{I mean you no harm, really.}
{146}{}{我没有恶意，真的。}

#{147}{}{Don't worry, I'm leaving.}
{147}{}{别担心，我就走。}

#{148}{Ara_15}{Hmmm. You may enter. But stay out of trouble.}
{148}{Ara_15}{嗯。你可以进我们的镇子。不过别惹麻烦。}

#{149}{}{What can you tell me about the other towns around here?}
{149}{}{你能给我说说这附近城镇的情况吗？}

#{150}{}{What's going on around here?}
{150}{}{镇子里最近有什么事吗？}

#{151}{}{Thanks. Bye.}

#{152}{Ara_17}{Greetings again, young wanderer. I hope your stay here has been pleasant.}
{152}{Ara_17}{你好，又再见了，年轻的旅行者。我希望你在镇子里过的愉快。}

#{153}{}{It's been great. Can I ask you some questions?}
{153}{}{这里很不错。我可以问些问题吗？}

#{154}{}{It has. I gotta run though.}
{154}{}{是的。不过我该走了。}

#{155}{}{If you like sewers.}
{155}{}{和下水道一样的破镇子。}

#{156}{}{Nuh-huh.}
{156}{}{嗯嗯。}

#{157}{Ara_18n}{Greetings. What may I help you with this fine day?}
{157}{Ara_18n}{你好。天气不错，我有什么能帮你吗？}

#{158}{Ara_18b}{Is there something you want?}
{158}{Ara_18b}{你有什么事？}

#{159}{}{Can you tell me about Shady Sands?}
{159}{}{你能告诉我一些关于沙荫镇的事情吗？}

#{160}{}{I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?}
{160}{}{我想我可以问你一些问题吗？}

#{161}{}{Nothing, really, I was just leaving.}
{161}{}{没事，真的没事，我要走了。}

#{162}{}{Nuh-uh.}
{162}{}{嗯嗯。}

#{163}{Ara_19}{Certainly. What do you wish to know?}
{163}{Ara_19}{当然可以。你希望知道什么？}

#{164}{Ara_19b}{You may ask, but please hurry. There are more important uses for my time.}
{164}{Ara_19b}{你可以问，不过请快点。我还有更重要的事情要费神。}

#{165}{}{What can you tell me about the other towns around here?}
{165}{}{你能给我说说这附近城镇的情况吗？}

#{166}{}{What's going on around here?}

#{168}{Ara_20g}{Ah. Happy journeys, wanderer.}
{168}{Ara_20g}{啊。祝你旅途愉快，旅行者。}

#{169}{Ara_20n}{Goodbye.}
{169}{Ara_20n}{再见。}

#{170}{Ara_20b}{I certainly hope so.}
{170}{Ara_20b}{求之不得。}

#{171}{Ara_21}{Dharma said, 'A man and his wayward tongue are soon parted.' Come back
#when you have learned some manners.}
{171}{Ara_21}{达玛说过，“无礼的舌头总有被割掉的一天。”等你什么时候懂得礼貌了再回来吧。}

#{172}{Ara_22}{That is quite enough, wanderer. Seth will show
#you out of the city. Do not return. Your welcome will not be pleasant.}
{172}{Ara_22}{这就实在是够了，旅行者。赛思会带你出城去。不要回来。和你交往很不愉快。}

#{173}{Ara_23g}{Shady Sands is much like a family, one that keeps
#to itself.}
{173}{Ara_23g}{沙荫镇很有家庭的感觉，自给自足。}

#{174}{Ara_23b}{We are a very protective community. As Dharma said,
#'Many sticks can be broken. A bundle cannot.'}
{174}{Ara_23b}{我们是一个很有自我保护意识的社区。如达玛所说，“一根筷子轻轻被折断，十根筷子牢牢抱成团。”}

#{175}{}{What kind of things do you have around here?}
{175}{}{镇子里有什么事情吗？}

#{176}{}{Interesting. Are there any other cities around here?}
{176}{}{有意思。这附近有任何其它城市吗？}

#{177}{}{How cute. Well, I better be going.}
{177}{}{真精辟啊。那么，我最好还是走吧。}

#{178}{Ara_24}{The Gardens are on the south side. The Brahma Pens
#are north, although the smell is, I fear, quite intense this time of year.}
{178}{Ara_24}{花园在南边。双头牛场在北边，虽然那里的气味实在是，我恐怕，在每年的这个时候相当强烈。}

#{179}{}{Anything else?}
{179}{}{还有什么吗？}

#{180}{Ara_24a}{We are small and self sufficient so there is little else
#to tell.}
{180}{Ara_24a}{我们是自给自足的小地方，所以没有多少说的。}

#{181}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{181}{}{谢谢。我可以多问一些问题吗？}

#{182}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{182}{}{谢谢。再见。}

#{183}{Ara_24b}{It is a small place. You have feet.}
{183}{Ara_24b}{这是一个小地方。你抬脚走一圈就明白了。}

#{184}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{184}{}{谢谢。我可以多问一些问题吗？}

#{185}{Ara_25b}{Dharma said, 'Heed not the call of the wolf when the fox is raiding
#the hen house.'}
{185}{Ara_25b}{达玛说，“杀鸡何用宰牛刀。”}

#{186}{Ara_25g}{Junktown lies south of here, though there is little in
#the way of visitation. From stories, I'm certain there
#are cities south of that.}
{186}{Ara_25g}{迦克镇在这里的南方，到那里的路上几乎没有其他镇子了。从各种传言来看，我很肯定迦克镇的南面还有不少城市。}

#{187}{}{Thanks. I . . . Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{187}{}{谢谢。我……我可以再问一些问题吗？}

#{188}{Ara_26}{It is a quiet time, thankfully.}
{188}{Ara_26}{幸运的，现在还没有什么事。}

#{189}{}{Sounds . . . boring}
{189}{}{听起来……挺闷。}

#{190}{}{Well, then, can I ask you a few more questions?}
{190}{}{嗯，那么，我可以再多问几个问题吗？}

#{191}{}{Good. Hopefully it will stay that way for a while.}
{191}{}{好。希望这样能维持一段时间。}

#{192}{Ara_27}{Yes. We like it that way.}
{192}{Ara_27}{是的。我希望能如此。}

#{193}{}{What can you tell me about the other towns around here?}
{193}{}{你能告诉我关于这里附近城镇的一些事吗？}

#{194}{}{What's going on around here?}
{194}{}{这里最近怎么样了？}

#{195}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{195}{}{谢谢。再见。}

#{196}{Ara_28}{Oh my yes. Great packs of Rad Scorpions are killing
#our herds. We don't know where they're from, and no
#matter how many we kill, there's always more!}
{196}{Ara_28}{哦，确实有。一大群辐射蝎正在杀我们的牛群。我们不知道他们从哪里来的，而且不管我们杀了多少辐射蝎，那里总会有更多的出现。}

#{197}{}{Go on.}
{197}{}{继续。}

#{198}{Ara_28a}{And now the monsters are attacking my people! Razlo
#is trying to find a cure for their poison, but I'm not
#sure how it goes.}
{198}{Ara_28a}{而且现在这些怪物正在攻击我的人民！拉斯洛正在寻找一种治疗蝎毒的方法，不过我不知道进展如何了。}

#{199}{}{Well, I'll help you get rid of these things!}
{199}{}{好，我会帮你消灭那些东西！}

#{200}{}{I can help you for a price.}
{200}{}{我可以帮助你，不过需要一定的代价。}

#{201}{}{That's terrible. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{201}{}{那真糟糕。我能再问你一些问题吗？}

#{202}{Ara_29}{Ummm, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Please talk to Razlo. He
#possesses far more information on these creatures than I.}
{202}{Ara_29}{嗯，好，好，好，好，好！请跟拉斯洛谈谈。他比我更清楚那种生物的事情。}

#{203}{Ara_30}{As Dharma said, 'Those who tend their own flock,
#know the shepherd.'}
{203}{Ara_30}{如达玛所说，“不在其位，不谋其政。”}

#{204}{}{I know it's hard for you to trust, but I would like
#to help.}
{204}{}{我知道你还不太信任我，不过我真的想帮帮忙。}

#{205}{}{Your choice. Can I ask you some more questions?}
{205}{}{随你。我能再问你点问题吗？}

#{206}{Ara_30a}{Please hurry and rid us of those Rad Scorpions!}
{206}{Ara_30a}{请尽快帮我们消灭掉那些辐射蝎！}

#{207}{Ara_31}{Things are much more settled now. Razlo has been working
#on a cure for Rad Scorpion poison, and with that, we should be
#able to fight what's left of them.}
{207}{Ara_31}{现在事情稳定多了。拉斯洛正在弄蝎毒的治疗方法，有了这个，我们应该就可以把还剩下来的辐射蝎消灭了。}

#{208}{}{It was nothing. Can I ask you some more questions?}
{208}{}{没什么。我可以再问你些问题吗？}

#{209}{}{You don't need to worry anymore. I destroyed the Nest.}
{209}{}{你不需要再担心什么了。我消灭了他们的巢穴。}

#{210}{Ara_32}{You are truly a hero! Know that the people of Shady
#Sands are most grateful.}
{210}{Ara_32}{你是一个真英雄！我们沙荫镇的人民非常感激你。}

#{211}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions, though?}
{211}{}{谢谢。那么我能再问你一些问题吗？}

#{212}{}{Thanks. Bye!}
{212}{}{谢谢。再见！}

#{213}{Ara_33}{If you can understand me, please try to find my
#daughter.}
{213}{Ara_33}{如果你知道我的意思，请你找到我的女儿。}

#{214}{Ara_35}{Since you brought my Tandi back to me, things are
#quite fine. My eternal gratitude to you, wanderer.}

#{218}{Ara_36}{Yes, yes. Umm. Have a good stay.}
{218}{Ara_36}{是，是。嗯。祝你在这愉快。}

#{219}{Ara_37}{Ahh, wanderer. How goes the search for my daughter?}
{219}{Ara_37}{啊，旅行者。寻找我女儿有什么进展吗？}

#{220}{}{Sorry, but I haven't found her. I will, though.}
{220}{}{抱歉，不过我还没有找到她。不过我会的。}

#{221}{}{I'm sorry, but she is dead.}
{221}{}{我非常遗憾，她已经死了。}

#{222}{}{Duh-nada.}
{222}{}{啊――啊啊。}

#{223}{}{Sorry, but I haven't found her. I will, though.}
{223}{}{抱歉，不过我还没有找到她。不过我会的。}

#{224}{}{Slow, but I am making some progress. Can I ask you
# a few more questions?}
{224}{}{不太乐观，不过正有进展。我能再问你一些问题吗？}

#{225}{}{Guunngggg!}
{225}{}{咕嗯!}

#{226}{Ara_37a}{Thank you for trying. Please leave me to my grief.}
{226}{Ara_37a}{你尽力了，谢谢。请让我一个人静静的哀悼。}

#{227}{Ara_38}{May my thoughts be wings to your feet. Please hurry.}
{227}{Ara_38}{愿你的思想成为你脚步的翅膀。请尽快。}

#{228}{Ara_39}{Thank goodness you came! I am in desperate
# need of assistance. My daughter, Tandi, is missing.

#{229}{}{Have you tried to save her?}
{229}{}{你营救过她吗？}

#{230}{}{Uhh?}
{230}{}{啊？}

#{231}{Ara_39a}{My people are not skilled in this. Already three patrols

{231}{Ara_39a}{我的人民不擅长这些。已经有三支巡逻队去寻找了，不过还没有任何一队回来。你会帮我吗？}

#{232}{}{Okay. Who could have taken her?}
{232}{}{好吧。谁可能把她带走？}

#{233}{}{I'll do it . . . for a fee.}
{233}{}{我能帮你的忙……不过你要出点血。}

#{234}{}{I am sorry, but I have other things I have to do.}
{234}{}{我很抱歉，不过我还有别的该去做的事。}

#{235}{Ara_40}{Seth and I believe one of the raider clans is
# responsible - retribution for our resistance to

# was last seen.}
{235}{Ara_40}{赛思和我相信是其中一伙强盗干的――为了报复我们的抵抗。拿上这把矛。这是我在女儿失踪的地方找到的。}

#{236}{}{Okay, I'll check it out.}
{236}{}{好的，我会去查查。}

#{237}{Ara_40A}{Please, talk to Seth. He knows much about these

{240}{}{啊……不，谢了。我还有别的事要做。}

#{241}{Ara_42}{As Dharma said, 'While you are out hunting the
# wolves, do not bring the lion to your den.' If you will
# not help, you must leave here.}

#{246}{Ara_45}{What are you doing? Put that back at once!}
{246}{Ara_45}{你在干什么？马上把它放回去！}

#{247}{Ara_46}{That is not yours. Please do not take it.}
{247}{Ara_46}{这个不是你的。请你不要拿走它。}

#{248}{Ara_47}{Stop that at once!}
{248}{Ara_47}{马上停止那么做！}

#{249}{Ara_48}{What are you doing here? I am resting, come back in the morning!}
{249}{Ara_48}{你在这里干什么？我正在休息，早上再来吧！}

#{250}{Ara_49}{I am he. I lead this humble town of Shady Sands.}
{250}{Ara_49}{我就是那个领导着沙荫镇的人。}

#{251}{Ara_49A}{Dharma was a great, religious man. You would do well to
# listen closely to his sayings.}
{251}{Ara_49A}{达玛是个伟大而虔诚的人。遵从他的指引，你就会成功。}

#{252}{Ara_50}{She is my daughter. It is she that makes this hard
# life worth living.}
{252}{Ara_50}{她是我的女儿，就是因为她，这里一切艰苦的生活都是值得的。}

#{253}{Ara_51}{Hmm, yes, yes. Razlo is our doctor. If it ails you,
# he can heal it. I would wager he is just a little
# north of here at this moment.}
{253}{Ara_51}{嗯，是的，是的，拉斯洛是我们的医生。他能治疗沙漠蝎的蛰伤。这会儿他肯定在这稍北处的房子里。}

#{254}{Ara_52}{A fine young man, Seth. Captain of our guards. He
# is likely to be at the Guard House. }
{254}{Ara_52}{赛思是个棒小伙。我们卫兵的队长。他可能在镇口的门房边。}

#{255}{Ara_53}{A wonderful woman. She just celebrated her sixtieth

{255}{Ara_53}{她可是个好姑娘。刚庆祝了她的16岁生日! 她常和拉斯洛待在一起, 总和他聊那些亲身经历，她都把那些故事当宝了。}

#{256}{Ara_54}{Ummm, um, um. Very bad. There are two bands of raiders
# that we know of. They call themselves the Vipers and
# the Khans.}
{256}{Ara_54}{哼，嗯，嗯。非常坏的家伙。据我们所知附近就有两伙歹徒。他们自称毒蛇和可汗。}

#{257}{Ara_55}{Be very careful with such as these. Raiders who are
# fanatically  religious can be quite dangerous. No one
# here knows of their base.}
{257}{Ara_55}{对这些人要尤其小心。那些狂信的歹徒非常危险。这里也没人知道他们的老巢在哪。}

#{258}{Ara_56}{Umm, yes, yes. The Khans are nastier then the Vipers,
# let me tell you. These barbarians attack from the
# southeast.}
{258}{Ara_56}{嗯啊，是的。要我说，那些可汗帮比毒蛇帮得更卑鄙。这些野蛮人都是从东南方向进攻的。}
