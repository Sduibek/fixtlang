#{100}{}{You see the Master of the Super Mutants.}
{100}{}{你看到超级变种人之主教。}
#{101}{Mast00}{So, what shall it be?  Do you join the Unity or do you die here? Join! Die! Join! Die!}
{101}{Mast00}{那么，你意何如？是加入我们的“同一”事业，还是在此粉身碎骨！？顺我者昌！逆我者亡！顺我着昌！逆我者亡！}
#{102}{}{I can't win.  I'll join you.}
{102}{}{我绝无机会胜你。我加入你们。}
#{103}{}{If you can prove to me that your Unity is the best course for humanity, then I will help you.}
{103}{}{如果你能向我证明你的“同一”对人类来说是最崇高的事业，那么我就帮助你。}
#{104}{}{How about you die, then I leave?}
{104}{}{我把你打烂然后飘然而去如何？}
#{105}{}{Oh, there will be death today, but not mine.  I've got a plan.}
{105}{}{哦，今天这里会有人死去，不过不是我。我已经胸有成竹。}
#{106}{}{Ugh. Lee.}
{106}{}{唔，咯。}
#{107}{Mast01}{Excellent. Your talents will be useful. But first, you must tell me everything about your Vault.}
{107}{Mast01}{很好。你可以在我麾下大展其才。不过首先，你必须告诉我你所在的避难所的一切事情。}
#{108}{}{Why?}
{108}{}{为什么？}
#{109}{}{OK.  I'll tell you everything you want to know.}
{109}{}{好吧。我会知无不言，言无不尽的。}
#{110}{Mast02}{I will conquer it and turn all those pure strain humans into mutants. They will give me the army I need to bring peace to the entire wasteland.}
{110}{Mast02}{我要征服那个避难所，把里边所有纯正基因的人类都变成变种人，组成足够数量的正义之师，将和平播洒至整个苍茫废土！}
#{111}{}{Sorry, I don't like that plan much.}
{111}{}{抱歉，我不太赞成你的这个计划。}
#{112}{}{Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.}
{112}{}{言之有理。我们动手吧！}
#{113}{Mast03}{So be it. You've dug your own grave. Grave! Grave!}
{113}{Mast03}{冥顽不化。你这是自掘坟墓！自掘坟墓！}
#{114}{Mast04}{I don't have to prove anything to you! Prove.}
{114}{Mast04}{我毋须对你证明任何事情！天理自存！}
#{115}{}{Your ego demands you tell me. All villains have this strange urge to explain everything.}
{115}{}{正是你自己的极端自负要求你澄清理由！所有大奸大恶之徒不都有胸有百万兵、口悬三尺剑的强烈冲动吗！？}
#{116}{}{I can't know you represent the best future, unless you prove it to me.}
{116}{}{你是否是未来理想世界的化身，除非你证明给我看，否则我何以知之？}
#{117}{Mast05}{Very demanding for one in your tenuous position. But I can respect your needs.}
{117}{Mast05}{以卑微之身而有如此非分之要求，也罢，我就屈尊回答你。}
#{118}{}{So tell me.}
{118}{}{愿闻其详。}
#{119}{Mast06}{The Unity will bring about the master race. Master! Master! One able to survive, or even thrive, in the wasteland. As long as there are differences, we will tear ourselves apart fighting each other. We need one race. Race! Race! One goal. Goal! Goal! One people . . . to move forward to our destiny. Destiny.}
{119}{Mast06}{“同一”事业会诞生主宰之族！主宰之族！唯一能在存于废土、立于废土、兴于废土的种族！种族之差异存在一日，彼此的争斗便一刻亦不会停歇。因此，我们需要唯一的种族！唯一的种族！同一个目标！同一个目标！万众一心去实现我们的命运！命运！}
#{120}{}{That race being the mutants, of course.}
{120}{}{这个种族无庸置疑就是变种人咯。}
#{121}{}{I hope we won't end up looking like you.}
{121}{}{我可不希望变成你们这副尊容。}
#{122}{Mast07}{Of course. Mutants are best equipped to deal with the world today. Who else? The ghouls. Please. Normals. They brought nuclear death to us all. This will be the age of mutants. Mutants.}
{122}{Mast07}{当然。变种人是最有能力接管这个世界的种族。还能有谁？僵尸？别开玩笑了。人类？是他们造成了全球的核浩劫。未来将是变种人的时代！变种人的时代！}
#{123}{}{You mean to change all the others into mutants, as well.}
{123}{}{你的意思是把其他种族都变成变种人。}
#{124}{}{You're such a bigot.}
{124}{}{你真是个独夫。}
#{125}{}{What about those who oppose you?}
{125}{}{反对你的人怎么办？}
#{126}{Mast08}{All that resist, yes. All those that are required for the Unity as well. The remainder will be allowed to live out their days, but under Unity control and protection. But none shall breed, for they will be the last of their race.}
{126}{Mast08}{所有反抗者，杀无赦，这也是“同一”事业所必须的程序。幸存的人将会在“同一”事业的控制和保护下苟活至死，但是这些孽族不准生育后代，他们将会是其种族的最后一代。}
#{127}{}{You've got a problem with your master plan.}
{127}{}{你的大计划有个纰漏。}
#{128}{}{Sounds like you've got it under control.  I'll join up.}
{128}{}{听起来你已经万事俱备。我要加入。}
#{129}{}{I think you are, all of you are, nuts and I need to stop you now.}
{129}{}{我认为你和这里所有的人都是疯狗，我必须现在就终止你们的邪恶计划。}
#{130}{Mast09}{And what is that?}
{130}{Mast09}{是什么？}
#{131}{}{You didn't take into account me! I'm stopping you right here, right now!}
{131}{}{你没有考虑到我的存在！我要摧毁你的野心，此时！此地！}
#{132}{}{You can't possibly take on the entire world.}
{132}{}{你不可能征服全世界。}
#{133}{}{I happen to know that your mutants are sterile.}
{133}{}{我正巧发现了你的变种人是不育的。}
#{134}{Mast10}{I'm not after the world, yet. When I turn your fellow vault-dwellers into mutants, my forces will be too strong for any to stand against! But don't worry, you won't care. Care! Care!}
{134}{Mast10}{我还没有启动征服世界的圣战。当我把你的避难所同胞变成变种人的时候，我的军队将所向披靡，横扫全球！但是你不必担心了，因为你看不到那天了！你看不到了！}
#{135}{Mast11}{Preposterous! The FEV-2 virus doesn't destroy the reproductive organs of those it mutates.}
{135}{Mast11}{荒谬绝伦！FEV－2型病毒不会破坏那些变种个体的生殖器官。}
#{136}{}{Perhaps the virus didn't sterilize people once, but it does now.}
{136}{}{或许病毒以前不会让人绝育，但是现在却是千真万确的事情。}
#{137}{}{Have you talked to any of your mutants about this?}
{137}{}{你问过你手下的变种人这个问题吗？}
#{138}{}{Maybe it's all that extra radiation.}
{138}{}{或许是过度的辐射造成的。}
#{139}{Mast12}{Do you have proof?}
{139}{Mast12}{你有证据吗？}
#{140}{}{Of course, I do! Here it is . . .}
{140}{}{那是自然！请看！这就是……}
#{141}{}{Take my word for it, it happens.}
{141}{}{相信我，是真的。}
#{142}{}{Ask your own mutants.}
{142}{}{问问你手下的变种人。}
#{143}{Mast13}{This proves nothing! You will pay for your insolence. Pay!}
{143}{Mast13}{无凭无据！你要为你的倨傲付出代价！付出代价！}
#{144}{}{I must digest this information. One moment.}
{144}{}{我必须研究一下这些信息。稍候。}
#{145}{Mast14}{I must digest this information. One moment . . . I understand now. You made a clever forgery. You made this up to fool me. Fool! Me!}
{145}{Mast14}{我必须研究一下这信息。少歇……我明白了。你的这个赝品足以乱真。你编造了这个来愚弄我！愚弄我！}
#{146}{}{What!? I don't understand, I thought it was correct!}
{146}{}{什么？！我不明白，我以为它是真的！}
#{147}{}{You're lying! You're denying the facts in front of you!}
{147}{}{你在撒谎！你还在事实面前狡辩！}
#{148}{Mast16}{You will pay for what you have done! Pay! Done.}
{148}{Mast16}{你会为你做的付出代价！付出代价！}
#{149}{Mast17}{But it cannot be. This would mean that all my work has been for nothing. Everything that I have tried to . . . a failure!  It can't be. Be. Be. Be.}
{149}{Mast17}{但这不可能！这意味着我所做的一切都付诸东流。我曾经努力的一切……彻底失败！这不可能。不！不！不！不～～～}
#{150}{}{Sorry, this isn't an option for you. Your race will die out after this generation.}
{150}{}{你的这条路是死路。你的种族将会在这一代之后灭绝。}
#{151}{}{Maybe there is something that can be done. Perhaps you need more test subjects.}
{151}{}{或许仍可挽回。比如再多找些试验品进一步研究。}
#{152}{Mast18}{Yes. More subjects. I think I shall start with you. Do! Do!}
{152}{Mast18}{对。更多的试验品。我想我应该从你开始！从你开始！从你开始！}
#{153}{Mast19}{I . . . don't think that I can continue. Continue? To have done the things I have done in the name of progress and healing. It was madness. I can see that now. Madness. Madness? There is no hope. Leave now, leave while you still have hope . . .}
{153}{Mast19}{我……我不能继续走下去了。继续？我所做的这些都是以进步和恢复为初衷。这太疯狂了。我现在明白了。疯狂。疯狂？我没希望了。你马上离开！你们还有希望，离开吧……}
#{154}{Mast20}{I believe I shall. Don't move.}
{154}{Mast20}{我会的。你不准动。}
#{155}{Mast21}{My scientists assure me that nothing is wrong. What do you say to that? Say! Say!}
{155}{Mast21}{我的科学家向我保证没有任何问题。你对此怎么解释？解释！解释！}
#{156}{}{Did you think to ask a female mutant?}
{156}{}{你从没有找个女变种人来问问？}
#{157}{}{Ask one of your Lieutenants.}
{157}{}{问问你的副官。}
#{158}{}{They're afraid of you. You think they'll tell you the truth?}
{158}{}{他们惧怕你。你认为他们会告诉你实情？}
#{159}{Mast22}{One moment. He cannot be reached. He must be dead and I can guess who killed him. Killed! Kill!}
{159}{Mast22}{稍等。我联系不上他。他肯定是死了，而且我知道是谁杀了他。谋杀！谋杀！}
#{160}{Mast23}{He denies everything. And he says he knows who started this rumor . . .}
{160}{Mast23}{他对一切都矢口否认。他还说是有人故意散布这个谣言……}
#{161}{Mast24}{I think I know who the liar is. Liar!}
{161}{Mast24}{我知道谁是骗子了。骗子！骗子！}
#{162}{Mast25}{Reasonable. One moment. Are you sure? What about the other females? It cannot be. Be.}
{162}{Mast25}{有道理。等等。你确定？其他女性呢？这不可能。不可能。}
#{163}{}{Sorry, your race is doomed.}
{163}{}{抱歉，你的种族注定会灭绝。}
#{164}{}{Excuse me while I gloat . . . Told ya so!}
{164}{}{原谅我用事实无情地打击了你！}
#{165}{Mast26}{Without any proof, I'm afraid I can't believe you. Now, you will join my army as a mutant or you will die! Die! Join!}
{165}{Mast26}{没有任何证据，我恐怕不能相信你。现在，你或者变成变种人加入我的军队，或者毁灭！毁灭！加入！}
#{166}{}{Better dead than like you.}
{166}{}{死也比变成你这副尊容强。}
#{167}{}{It means giving up everything I know, but I'll join.}
{167}{}{虽然我知道这意味着放弃一切，不过我会加入。}
#{168}{Mast27}{Your humor will not save you now. Do you accept my offer, or not? Not! Accept!}
{168}{Mast27}{你的幽默救不了你。你是接受我的提议还是拒绝？拒绝！接受！}
#{169}{}{Not.}
{169}{}{你去死。}
#{170}{}{OK, it's better than dying . . .}
{170}{}{哦，好死不如赖活着……}
#{171}{Mast28}{Radiation has no effect on us. The FEV virus makes us immune. Your argument is weak, and so are you.}
{171}{Mast28}{辐射在我们身上无效。FEV病毒让我们免疫辐射。你的论据是苍白无力的，你也一样。}
#{172}{Mast29}{Oh, I think you are wrong. But just to be sure, I will order this matter researched. After I have taken care of you. Care. Care!}
{172}{Mast29}{哼，你这是一派胡言。不过为了确认真相，我会下令调查这件事。不过，那是在我处理掉你之后。处理！处理！}
#{173}{Mast30}{My only problem is you. Now, will you work for the Unity, or not?}
{173}{Mast30}{我唯一的顾虑就是你。那么，你是要加入我们还是拒绝？}
#{174}{}{Not.}
{174}{}{你去做梦吧。}
#{175}{}{Sure.}
{175}{}{我加入。}
#{176}{Mast31}{They will be punished for their insolence.}
{176}{Mast31}{他们将为他们的傲慢付出代价。}
#{177}{}{You mean to kill them all?}
{177}{}{你是说把他们全宰了？}
#{178}{}{Then I must stop you now!}
{178}{}{那么我必须立刻阻止你！}
#{179}{Mast32}{Of course not. Most will be offered a chance to become a mutant. Those who deny this opportunity will be sterilized and let go. Those that resist will be executed.}
{179}{Mast32}{当然不是。大部分人有机会成为变种人。拒绝变异的会被绝育，然后释放。反抗绝育的则会被处死。}
#{180}{}{You are one sick puppy. Time to put you down.}
{180}{}{你是个变态的禽兽。你的死期到了。}
#{181}{}{Hmm, I'm not big on being executed . . . I'm joining.}
{181}{}{啊，我还不想死……我加入。}
#{182}{Mast33}{We are all biased, are we not?  We each care more about our individual communities than other people. We haven't changed, and I'll tell you something else . . .}
{182}{Mast33}{我们都有自己的立场，不是吗？我们都比其他人更关心各自的群体。我们从来都没有改变。但是，现在我会指给你看另外一条路……}
#{183}{}{What's that?}
{183}{}{什么？}
#{184}{Mast34}{We won't change. Not unless we are of one people. One. One. One. One race. One. One. One. The Unity will allow us to move beyond these petty concerns and deal with the major problems at hand.  You want to be a part of that, don't you? Part. Don't.}
{184}{Mast34}{我们永远都不会改变的。除非我们万宗归一。归一。归一。归一。成为一个种族。一个种族。一个种族。一个种族。“同一”事业会使我们略过那些小的厉害冲突，解决眼前的大问题。你想加入吗？想？不想？}
#{185}{}{You've convinced me. I'll join the Unity.}
{185}{}{你说的对。我加入。}
#{186}{}{I want a part of you . . . your head!}
{186}{}{我想！我想把你的脑袋削了！}
#{187}{Mast35}{Of course! The mutants will survive! The mutants will rebuild this world! And only as a mutant, will you be allowed to live! Live. Die!}
{187}{Mast35}{当然！变种人会存活下来！变种人会重建这个世界！你只有做为变种人才被允许存在！存在！毁灭！}
#{188}{}{Live!}
{188}{}{我愿意变成变种人！}
#{189}{}{Die!}
{189}{}{去死！}
#{190}{}{All you care about is your mutants and their Unity.}
{190}{}{你所关心的全部就是你的变种人和“同一”事业。}
#{191}{Mast36}{I am no villain. You have no idea what I, or the Unity is about.}
{191}{Mast36}{我不是个恶人。你不了解我，也不了解“同一”。}
#{192}{}{Then tell me what you are about.}
{192}{}{那告诉我你是怎样的人。}
#{193}{}{You are a villain. You're just denying your inner feelings.}
{193}{}{你是个坏人。你只是在否认你内心的感受。}
#{194}{Mast37}{I don't have to prove myself to you. Using your logic, that must, prove I am not a villain. It would be a hopeless cause to explain it to you. }
{194}{Mast37}{我无须向你证明我自己，用你的脑子理性地思考，你肯定能说服自己我不是个坏人。向你解释这件事是白费功夫。}
#{195}{Mast38}{Oh? Please, what sort of plan might that be?}
{195}{Mast38}{哦？请问，你有怎样的计划呢？}
#{196}{}{I'm going to set off a nuclear device in this Vault. It will explode shortly, taking you all to hell!}
{196}{}{我打算引爆这个避难所里的核弹。它马上就会爆炸，把你们全送去见阎王！}
#{197}{}{I'll kill you and that'll make it difficult for you to continue, right?}
{197}{}{我宰了你，这样你就不能继续为恶了，对吗？}
#{198}{}{I convinced the Brotherhood of Steel to invade this place if I was captured and not set free.  They will be here any moment.}
{198}{}{我说服钢铁兄弟会，假如我被俘并且没被释放，就攻打这里。他们可能随时到达。}
#{199}{Mast39}{You might be telling the truth. It doesn't matter, but I will let you go for now.}
{199}{Mast39}{你说的可能是真话。这无所谓，我现在可以放你走。}
#{200}{Mast40}{You are lying. It will be the last lie that you tell. }
{200}{Mast40}{你在撒谎。这将是你说得最后一个谎话。}
#{201}{Mast41}{One moment while I check out your story. You might be telling the truth. Guards! Take this human to the reactor core. Deal with the problem before it's too late.}
{201}{Mast41}{等一下，我看看你是不是在骗我……你说的是真的。警卫！把这个人类带到反应堆内核，在爆炸前解除核弹。}
#{202}{Mast42}{I doubt even the FEV will help you. Why am I talking? It's unlikely you even understand . . .}
{202}{Mast42}{FEV病毒都治不了你的榆木脑袋。为什么我要和你说话？你甚至可能都无法理解……}
#{203}{Mast43}{You must be joking. }
{203}{Mast43}{你一定在开玩笑。}
#{204}{Mast44}{My patience is almost at an end with you. Now, will you join the Unity or not? Join. Not!}
{204}{Mast44}{我快对你失去耐心了。现在，你是加入组织还是拒绝？加入。拒绝！}
#{205}{}{Yes.}
{205}{}{加入。}
#{206}{}{No.}
{206}{}{不加入。}
#{207}{Mast45}{Fine. Then you can die here and now!}
{207}{Mast45}{很好。那么你可以立即毙命于此！}
#{208}{Mast46}{You have disarmed the device. Excellent. Tell me, is there anything you wanted to say before I kill you?}
{208}{Mast46}{你们已经将核弹拆了。很好。告诉我，在你临死前还有什么遗言吗？}
#{209}{}{Yes, can I join up with you now?}
{209}{}{是的，我现在能加入你们吗？}
#{210}{}{Even dead, I'll still look better than you.}
{210}{}{就算死了，我也会比你长得好看。}
#{211}{Mast47}{No. No. No. No.}
{211}{Mast47}{不能。不能。不能。不能。}
#{212}{Mast200}{I am the Master. I don't have to answer to you.}
{212}{Mast200}{我是主宰。我不需要回答你。}
#{213}{Mast201}{I am not here to answer your questions. You are here to answer mine.}
{213}{Mast201}{你没资格问我，该是我问你！}
#{214}{Mast202}{Once I have the location of your vault, I will fulfill my destiny! Destiny! Destiny! Destiny!}
{214}{Mast202}{一旦我找到你的避难所的位置，我将会实现我的理想！理想！理想！理想！}
#{215}{Mast203}{You think you can destroy me!? Destroy! Me?}
{215}{Mast203}{你认为你能消灭我！？消灭！？我？！}
#{300}{}{Duh!}
{300}{}{呸!}
