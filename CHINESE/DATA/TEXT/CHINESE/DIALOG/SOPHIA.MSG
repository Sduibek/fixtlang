{117}{}{我们在晚上不能做任何事。请在白天来见我们。}

#{118}{}{It's night. You should be in bed, unless you have guard duty, in which case you should be at your post.}
{118}{}{现在是晚上。你应该在床上睡觉，除非你有守卫任务，但即使是那样你也应该在岗位上。}

#{200}{}{Hello Initiate. How may I help you?}
{200}{}{你好，新兵。我能帮你吗？}

#{201}{}{I understand you have something for me?}
{201}{}{我认为你有什么东西要给我。}

#{202}{}{Yes, here you are.}

{207}{}{呃，谢谢你。你还好吗？不管怎么说还是谢谢你带来这些东西。}

#{208}{}{My research would have been delayed without them. It's good to see we have such a trustworthy Initiate.
# I knew getting an outsider wouldn't be a bad decision. If you go see Michael he will have something for you.}
{208}{}{没有这些东西我的研究就不得不停止了。我很高兴我们有一个像你这样值得信任的新兵，我早就知道让一个外来者加入不可能有错的。如果你去见迈克尔他会给你些东西的。}

#{301}{}{Greetings.  I have not seen you here before, are you lost?
# May I be of service?}
{301}{}{你好。我从前没有在这边见过你，你迷路了吗？我能帮忙吗？}

#{302}{}{Uh......}
{302}{}{这……}

#{303}{}{Could you direct me to the library?}
{303}{}{你能告诉我图书馆怎么走吗？}

#{304}{}{I am looking for Vree.}
{304}{}{我在找弗蕾。}

#{305}{}{What is this place?}
{305}{}{这里是哪里？}

#{306}{}{If I was lost I wouldn't be asking an idiot like you for help!}
{306}{}{就算我迷路了，我也不会找你这样的白痴问路！}

#{307}{}{I can't believe the kind of people we accept as initiates these
# days.  God help us.}
{307}{}{我简直不敢相信，现在我们会接受这样的人来做新兵。上天保佑。}

#{308}{}{This is the library.  Here we keep records of all technical data on
# weaponry and technology, and, of course, the history of the Brotherhood.}
{308}{}{这里是图书馆。我们在这里存储所有关于武器和科技的资料，当然，我们也有关于兄弟会的历史。}

#{309}{}{I need a water-chip repaired.  Can you help me?}
{309}{}{我必须要修理好一个净水芯片。你能帮我吗？}

#{310}{}{I'd like to know more about the weapons you make here.}

#{312}{}{Never mind, thank you for your time.}
{312}{}{不用了，谢谢你的帮忙。}

#{313}{}{I'm looking for a big gun to improve my people-killing skills.}
{313}{}{我在找一支可以提高我杀人技术的大枪。}

#{314}{}{I am Vree's assistant.  Vree is over there.}
{314}{}{我是弗蕾的助手。弗蕾在那边。}

#{315}{}{Thank you.}
{315}{}{谢谢你。}

#{316}{}{What is it you do as Vree's assistant?}
{316}{}{你作为弗蕾的助手都做些什么呢？}

#{317}{}{My area of expertise is the history of the Brotherhood.  It sounds
# like a manufacturing problem, perhaps you should ask Vree?}
{317}{}{我的专业涉及的是兄弟会历史方面。你的问题似乎是一个制造方面的问题，也许你该去问弗蕾。}

#{318}{}{I thought the scribes knew this kind of stuff.}
{318}{}{我以为你们研究员都知道这方面的事情。}

#{319}{}{I'd like to know about the Brotherhood's history.}
{319}{}{我想了解兄弟会的历史。}

#{320}{}{Lotta help you are!}
{320}{}{你的帮助实在太大啦！}

#{321}{}{OK, thanks for your help.}
{321}{}{好的，谢谢你。}

#{322}{}{You must speak with Vree, the head scribe, about that.  I have more
# important things to do.}
{322}{}{关于那件事你必须和研究员负责人弗蕾谈。我有更重要的事情要做。}

#{323}{}{I will go ask Vree.}
{323}{}{我会去问弗蕾的。}

#{324}{}{More important things to do?  Like what?}
{324}{}{更重要的事情？比如说呢？}

#{325}{}{You don't consider the Brotherhood's weaponry to be important?}
{325}{}{你认为兄弟会的武器制造不重要吗？}

#{326}{}{We have many holo-disks here in the library.  They are divided
# between history, technology and weapon design.}
{326}{}{图书馆里有许多磁盘。它们分为历史，科技和武器设计三类。}

#{327}{}{I would like to see a holo-disk on your technology.}
{327}{}{我想看看科技方面的磁盘。}

#{328}{}{I would like to see a holo-disk on weapon design.}
{328}{}{我想看看武器设计方面的磁盘。}

#{329}{}{I would like to see a holo-disk on the Brotherhood's history.}
{329}{}{我想看看兄弟会历史方面的磁盘。}

#{330}{}{I was sent here to ask Vree about the history of the Brotherhood.}
{330}{}{我被派到这里问弗蕾关于兄弟会历史的问题。}

#{331}{}{My area of specialty is the Brotherhood's history.  It seems that
# some people around here have forgotten the importance of our history.}
{331}{}{我的专业领域是兄弟会历史方面。好像有些人已经开始忘记我们历史的重要性了。}

#{332}{}{What can you tell me about the Brotherhood's history?}
{332}{}{关于兄弟会的历史你能告诉我什么？}

#{333}{}{What could be more important than history?}
{333}{}{有什么会比历史更重要呢？}

#{334}{}{Must be near your time of the month, huh?}
{334}{}{你每个月的那几天快来了吧？}

#{335}{}{I'd like to ask somebody about weapons.}
{335}{}{我想问问别人关于武器的事。}

#{336}{}{Like keeping the history of the Brotherhood.  It seems some people
# around here have forgotten just how important our history is.}
{336}{}{像是保管兄弟会历史等等。看上去有些人已经开始忘记我们历史的重要性了。}

#{337}{}{Vree seems to think that the research of new weaponry and the
# information gathered from Mutant autopsies is more important than our
# history.  She has forgotten that our history is a vital part of our lives.
# It has gotten so bad that many of the new initiates don't even know who
# Roger Maxson is or what exactly he did for us.}
{337}{}{弗蕾似乎认为，研究开发新的武器以及解剖变种人尸体比历史更为重要。她忘记了，我们的历史是我们生命的重要组成部分，现在的情况已经很坏了，有很多新兵甚至不知道罗杰・马克松是谁，以及他究竟为我们做过什么。}

#{338}{}{I'd like to learn more about the Brotherhood's history.  Do you have
# any information you can give me?}
{338}{}{我想要学习关于兄弟会历史的更多知识。你有什么资料可以给我吗？}

#{339}{}{Hmmm, it looks like Vree is the person I want to talk to. Good Bye.}
{339}{}{嗯，也许弗蕾才是我真正想见的人。再见。}

#{341}{}{It sounds like Vree's got the right idea!  Who needs to know this
# garbage anyway!?!}
{341}{}{听起来弗蕾是对的！谁想要了解这些垃圾呢？！}

#{342}{}{I agree that history is important, but new technology and better
# weapons is what I'm looking for.}
{342}{}{我也认为历史是十分重要的，但我现在要找的是新的科技和更好的武器。}

#{343}{}{You need to speak with Vree about things of that nature.}
{343}{}{这种事情你得去和弗蕾谈。}

#{344}{}{These are things that only Scribes and Paladins have access to.
# Vree may be able to help you.}
{344}{}{这些事只有导师和游侠才有资格决定。弗蕾也许可以帮你。}

#{345}{}{Thank you, I'll go ask Vree.}
{345}{}{谢谢你，我会去问弗蕾的。}

#{346}{}{Is there any holo-disks that I can have access to?}
{346}{}{这边有我能拿到的磁盘吗？}

#{347}{}{You're obviously not the right person to be talking to. Good Bye.}
{347}{}{很显然，你并不是正确的谈话对象。再见。}

#{348}{}{Well, it's good to see someone interested in our great history.
# Unlike others around here.  Here you go. This is a disk of some of our earliest writings.}
{348}{}{啊，能见到对我们的伟大历史感兴趣的人真是太好了。你不像这边的其他人。给你这个。这是一张记载着我们最初历史的磁盘。}

#{349}{}{Thank you.}
{349}{}{谢谢你。}

#{350}{}{I don't care about this crap.  Thanks for nothing.}
{350}{}{我不想要这个。不过还是谢谢。}

#{351}{}{Our history is available to everyone.  So that they may learn of our
# great history...Not that any one ever looks at them.}
{351}{}{我们的历史每个人都可以看。这样他们才有可能学到我们的历史……而不是泛泛地看看。}

#{352}{}{I would like to see anything you have on the Brother's history.}
{352}{}{我想看看你还有什么关于兄弟会历史的东西。}

#{353}{}{Really? I don't care either, just show me the guns.}
{353}{}{是吗？我也不在意那个，只要你把枪拿出来给我看。}

#{354}{}{Greetings.  I have not seen you here before, are you lost?  May I be
# of service?}
{354}{}{你好。我从前没有在这边见过你，你迷路了吗？我能帮忙吗？}

#{355}{}{Uh......}
{355}{}{这……}

#{356}{}{Could you direct me to the library?}
{356}{}{你能告诉我图书馆怎么走吗？}

#{357}{}{I was sent here to speak with Vree about the Brotherhood's history.}
{357}{}{我在找弗蕾。}

#{358}{}{If I was lost I wouldn't be asking an idiot like you for help!}
{358}{}{就算我迷路了，我也不会找你这样的白痴问路！}

#{359}{}{You didn't get far with that did you?  Vree's is to busy with her
# "experiments" to care about history any more.}
{359}{}{你没听明白我的话吧？弗蕾正在忙于做那些“实验”，根本没空回答关于历史的问题。}

#{360}{}{Well, then who can I talk to about the history of the Brotherhood?}
{360}{}{那么谁能告诉我关于兄弟会的历史呢？}

#{361}{}{Yeah, the Brotherhood seems to be filled with idiots.}
{361}{}{没错，看起来兄弟会的确是充满了白痴。}

#{362}{}{Neither do I.  Good Bye.}
{362}{}{我也没空。再见。}

#{363}{}{I will not talk with you.}
{363}{}{我不会和你谈的。}

#{364}{}{How can I help you?}
{364}{}{我能帮你吗？}

#{365}{}{What do you do here?}
{365}{}{你在这里做什么？}

#{366}{}{Could you tell me about the Brotherhood's history.}
{366}{}{你能告诉我关于兄弟会历史的事情吗？}

#{367}{}{Sorry, I thought you were someone else.  Good bye.}
{367}{}{对不起，我认错人了。再见。}

#{368}{}{I am Vree's assistant.}
{368}{}{我是弗蕾的助手。}

#{369}{}{Thank you.}
{369}{}{谢谢你。}

#{370}{}{What is it you do as Vree's assistant?}
{370}{}{你作为弗蕾的助手都做些什么呢？}

#{371}{}{Well, it's good to see someone interested in our great history.
# Unlike others around here.  Here you go. This is a disk of some of our earliest writings.}
{371}{}{啊，能见到对我们的伟大历史感兴趣的人真是太好了。你不像这边的其他人。给你这个。这是一张记载着我们最初历史的磁盘。}

#{372}{}{Thank you.}
{372}{}{谢谢你。}

#{373}{}{I don't care about this crap.  Thanks for nothing.}
{373}{}{我不想要这个。不过还是谢谢。}

#{374}{}{I gave you the disk with some of our early writings on it.  Just
# load it up into your PIPBoy 2000 and you will be able to read it.}
{374}{}{我已经给了你载有我们最初历史的磁盘。只要把它下载到你的哔哔小子2000上就可以阅读了。}

#{375}{}{Thank you.}
{375}{}{谢谢你。}

#{376}{}{I don't care about this crap.  Thanks for nothing.}
{376}{}{我不想要这个。不过还是谢谢。}

#{377}{}{I don't like your attitude, and I choose not to talk to you.}
{377}{}{我不喜欢你的态度，我决定不和你聊天了。}

#{378}{}{So be it. Good bye!}
{378}{}{那就这样吧。再见！}

#{379}{}{I'm sorry, I was very rude and I apologize.}
{379}{}{对不起，我太鲁莽了。我道歉。}

#{380}{}{I accept your apology.  Now how can I help you? }
{380}{}{我接受你的道歉。现在我能帮你什么呢？}

#{381}{}{What do you do here?}
{381}{}{你在这里做什么？}

#{382}{}{Could you tell me about the Brotherhood's history.}
{382}{}{你能告诉我关于兄弟会历史的事情吗？}

#{383}{}{Sorry, I thought you were someone else.  Good bye.}
{383}{}{对不起，我认错人了。再见。}

#{384}{}{I am Vree's assistant.  Vree is in the Learning Center.}
{384}{}{我是弗蕾的助手。弗蕾在研究中心里。}

#{400}{}{You see an instructor for the Brotherhood Initiates.}
{400}{}{你看到一个兄弟会新兵的指导员。}
