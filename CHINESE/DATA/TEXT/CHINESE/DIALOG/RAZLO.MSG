#{100}{}{You see Razlo.}
#{101}{}{I'm sorry but I can't help you.}
#{102}{}{Can't or won't?}
#{103}{}{Razlo looks at you for a moment, and then turns away.}
#{104}{}{You look distraught. Are you in need of assistance?}
#{105}{}{Tandi has been kidnapped.}
#{106}{}{Hng, Tanny boo.}
#{107}{}{Tandi is gone? That is a terrible thing. I hope they find her.}
#{108}{}{Hmm, Tandi is gone? I find this hard to believe, but maybe
# she ran away with Seth. I know that they have been eyeing
# each other lately. Aradesh was always a little bit of a
# prude, perhaps it was too much for her finally.}
#{109}{}{Hmm, I didn't think of that.}
#{110}{}{I don't think so, I think that she was kidnapped.}
#{111}{}{Perhaps, I'll go talk to some other people.}
#{112}{}{How awful! If that is the case, I hope she is not hurt.
# Who is looking for her?}
#{113}{}{Almost everyone.}
#{114}{}{Many people, including myself.}
#{115}{}{I hope she is found before it is too late.}
#{116}{}{If she is hurt, it could be bad. Here, take these . . .
# I hope that you won't need them.}
#{117}{}{I hope Tandi gets back soon. Aradesh must be feeling
# terrible right now.}
#{118}{}{I heard that you helped save Tandi. Congratulations
# and thank you. Anytime you need healing, come here.}
#{119}{}{My grief knows no end. Tandi, the only child of my
# good friend, is gone. I cannot work right now.}
#{120}{}{I'm Razlo. Can I help you?}
#{121}{}{Not right now, but it was nice meeting you.}
#{122}{}{I need healing.}
#{123}{}{Hnngh!}
#{124}{}{Hmmm. I think I've seen Brahmin with more brain cells
# then you. Well, let's see if you're wounded.}
#{125}{}{Well, you seem fine to me. Perhaps later, then?}
#{126}{}{Let's see here.}
#{127}{}{I have already given you as much as I can. Good luck.}
#{128}{}{Hmmm, I don't like your looks. I hope that you have come
# for business, and will be moving on shortly . . .}
#{129}{}{No need to get defensive, I'm just looking around}
#{130}{}{Help, I need some healing.}
#{131}{}{Hello, again. How can I be of service?}
#{132}{}{Hello again. Just stopping by.}
#{133}{}{I need healing.}
#{134}{}{Ug!}
#{135}{}{It was nice seeing you again. Have a good day.}
#{136}{}{Of course. It's you again. Now what?}
#{137}{}{Nothing.}
#{138}{}{I need healing.}
#{139}{}{Luki!}
#{140}{}{Of course you do.}
#{141}{}{Can I help you?}
#{142}{}{No.}
#{143}{}{I need healing.}
#{144}{}{I've been poisoned!}
#{145}{}{What do you know about Radscorpions?}
#{146}{}{I have a sample of the Radscorpion poison, can you do
# something with it?}
#{147}{}{Luki!}
#{148}{}{Sorry, I can't cure any poisons. I don't have the
# proper ingredients to make a decent anti-venom.}
#{149}{}{Here, let's see.}
#{150}{}{Yep, just as I thought. Let me get the cure.}
#{151}{}{You seem fine, now. Be careful in the future.}
#{152}{}{Stop by again, but stay healthy next time.}
#{153}{}{Not too much. They seem to be extremely large versions
# of the north American Emperor scorpion. Contrary to my
# medical knowledge, their poison has grown more potent,
# not diluted, as I would expect. Seth has been hunting them, which helps
# some of my tests.}
#{154}{}{And how such a large
# creature can even be possible by natural evolution,
# or even radiation induced mutation is beyond me.}
#{155}{}{Thanks.}
#{156}{}{You seem well educated. What are you doing here?}
#{157}{}{Anything else?}
#{158}{}{They seem to be sensitive to light. Nocturnal. If I
# could get a sample of their poison, especially the
# venom production sac located in their tail, I could
# create an anti-venom.}
#{159}{}{Thanks.}
#{160}{}{Doc Morbid in Junktown taught me some. And just
# because we live in stone huts, does not mean we are
# less intelligent or educated. Have a nice day.}
#{161}{}{Let me see the sac! Yes, I can do something with
# this.}
#{162}{}{Here, take this as a free sample. It seems to work
# well against radscorpion stings, of course, but it
# shows much potential as a general anti-venom and
# poison cure.}
#{163}{}{It's late. Come back in the morning.}
#{164}{}{But I need your help.}
#{165}{}{I'm trying to kill some radscorpions. Do you have anything
# to help?}
#{166}{}{I'm looking for Tandi. Can you help?}
#{167}{}{Hnn.}
#{168}{}{Hnn?! What is that? Great, I get awakened by the great
# mumbling beast of the north. Come back in the morning.}
#{169}{}{Are you hurt?}
#{170}{}{Yes.}
#{171}{}{No.}
#{172}{}{You will be, if you keep me from my sleep. Now come
# back in the morning.}
#{173}{}{Great Brahmin! Why didn't you say so?}
#{174}{}{Uhhh. I did . . .}
#{175}{}{You're barely hurt. I suggest a good nights sleep and
# some rest; you will heal naturally over time.}
#{176}{}{You're barely hurt, you wimp. Come back in the morning.}
#{177}{}{Ouch, that does look a little painful. That will be $25.}
#{178}{}{OK, here you go.}
#{179}{}{I don't have enough money.}
#{180}{}{Oh Great Brahmin! That is very, very serious. It will
# cost $50.}
#{181}{}{OK, here you go.}
#{182}{}{I don't have enough money.}
#{183}{}{How can you still be walking?! This looks extremely
# serious. We'll need some special prayers for this one
# and a lot of luck. Not to mention $100.}
#{184}{}{OK, here you go.}
#{185}{}{I don't have enough money.}
#{186}{}{You don't have enough money! I'm sorry, but my work ethic
# doesn't permit me to heal for free, you know. Come back
# when you have enough money.}
#{187}{}{Can you take something in trade?}
#{188}{}{Thanks for nothing.}
#{189}{}{Sorry, not today.}
#{190}{}{Why would I be able to help you kill radscorpions?
# I'm a doctor, not a warrior. For that you should see
# Aradesh, or even Tandi, or her boyfriend, Seth. Leave
# me.}
#{191}{}{I need something for their poison.}
#{192}{}{If I had a sample of their poison, I could create
# a cure.}
#{194}{}{I don't think so, I think that she was kidnapped.}
#{195}{}{Perhaps, I'll go talk to some other people.}
#{196}{}{This will take a little bit of time. Come, relax in
# the back. You might have a slight headache from the
# junja juice, as well. Come, come . . .}
#{197}{}{I have already given you as much as I can. Good luck.}
#{300}{}{You gain 250 experience points for helping make the antidote.}
#{301}{}{K, me giv?}
#{302}{}{Nunga.}
#{303}{}{Scorpin, Scorpin?}
#{304}{}{My giv dis?}
#{305}{}{How about a Radscorpion tail instead?}
#{306}{}{Let me see the sac! Yes, I can do something with
# this, as well as heal you for this great gift.}
#{307}{}{This will take a little bit of time. Come, relax in
# the back, while I work with the sac. You might have a slight headache from the
# junja juice, as well. Come, come . . .}
#{308}{}{Please do not take my things.}

#{1101}{}{He leads the Khans.  He is one of the most dangerous men that

#{1102}{}{It's 4-6 days to the southwest.  Good trading occasionally, but

#{1103}{}{You're standing in it.}
#{1104}{}{Much farther to the south than Junktown.  The Hub is the largest

#{1105}{}{Sorry, I can't help you.}
#{1106}{}{She is the daughter of Aradesh.  Some day she could lead us, but

{100}{}{你看到拉斯洛。}
{101}{}{对不起，我帮不了你。}
{102}{}{不想还是不能？}
{103}{}{拉斯洛打量了你一会儿，就转过身去了。}
{104}{}{你看起来有心事，要帮忙吗？}
{105}{}{坦蒂被绑架了。}
{106}{}{啊，大波坦蒂。}
{107}{}{坦蒂不见了？太糟糕了。希望他们能找到她。}
{108}{}{哦，坦蒂不见了。真难以置信。没准她跟赛思私奔了。我知道他们最近一直眉来眼去的。亚拉德什一直有点太古板了，也许坦蒂终于受够了。}
{109}{}{恩，我没想到这个……}
{110}{}{我不这么认为，我想她是被绑架了。}
{111}{}{也许吧，我会跟其他人谈谈的。}
{112}{}{太糟糕了。如果真是那样，希望她没受伤害，有谁在找她？}
{113}{}{几乎所有人。}
{114}{}{很多人，包括我。}
{115}{}{希望能及时找到她。}
{116}{}{如果她受伤了，可能会很严重。给，拿着这些……希望你用不到这些东西。}
{117}{}{希望坦蒂能尽快回来。亚德拉什现在一定很难过。}
{118}{}{听说你帮忙救了坦蒂。谢谢你。需要治疗就过来吧。}
{119}{}{我无法停止悲伤。坦蒂，我朋友唯一的孩子没了。现在我没法工作。}
{120}{}{我是拉斯洛，能帮你吗？}
{121}{}{目前不需要，不过很高兴见到你。}
{122}{}{我需要医疗。}
{123}{}{哈啊！}
{124}{}{唉，我觉得双头牛的脑细胞都比你多。好吧，我来看看你有没有受伤。}
{125}{}{你看来没问题。有需要再来吧，好吗？}
{126}{}{我来看看。}
{127}{}{我尽力帮你了。好运。}
{128}{}{啊，我不喜欢你的样子。希望你是的确有事才来的，而且很快会离开。}
{129}{}{别这么提防我，我只是到处逛逛。}
{130}{}{帮帮我，我需要治疗。}
{131}{}{你好，又是你，我能帮你点什么？}
{132}{}{你还好吗，只是顺道过来一下。}
{133}{}{我需要医疗。}
{134}{}{哇！}
{135}{}{很高兴再次见到你。祝你有美好的一天。}
{136}{}{哦，又是你。又怎么了。}
{137}{}{没事。}
{138}{}{我需要医护。}
{139}{}{运气！}
{140}{}{哦，当然。}
{141}{}{能帮你吗？}
{142}{}{不。}
{143}{}{我需要治疗。}
{144}{}{我中毒了。}
{145}{}{你对辐射蝎了解多少？}
{146}{}{我有一份辐射蝎毒的样本，能做点什么吗？}
{147}{}{运气！}
{148}{}{对不起，我没法解毒。我没有合适的材料来做出有效的解毒剂。}
{149}{}{那咱们就瞧瞧。}
{150}{}{没错，跟我想的一样。我去拿药。}
{151}{}{你现在看起来没什么。不过以后要小心。}
{152}{}{有空再过来吧，不过下次可别带着伤来了。}
{153}{}{不太多。它们似乎是超大版的北美帝王蝎。跟我所学相悖的是，它们的毒性没有象我预想的那样减弱，反而在增强。赛思一直在猎杀它们来帮助我的研究。}
{154}{}{还有这么大的生物怎么会被自然进化出来呢，如果因辐射而突变的，又是怎样的变异过程呢，我正试图找到答案。}
{155}{}{谢谢。}
{156}{}{你似乎受过良好教育，为什么会呆在这里？}
{157}{}{还有别的吗？}
{158}{}{它们似乎对光很敏感。是夜行生物。如果我能得到它们毒素的样本，尤其是位于尾部制造毒液的部分。我应该能做出解毒剂。}
{159}{}{谢谢。}
{160}{}{迦克镇的莫彼得德医生教过我一些东西。我们的确是住在小石头屋子里的人，可这并不表示我们没有天赋和知识。走好！}
{161}{}{让我看看！没错！我可以借此做些努力。}
{162}{}{给，当这是免费样品拿走吧。似乎这对辐射蝎的蜇伤很有效，当然，这将来也能作为抗毒，解毒剂广泛应用。}
{163}{}{太晚了。明天请早。}
{164}{}{可我需要你帮忙。}
{165}{}{我要试着去杀些辐射蝎，你有什么能帮的上的东西吗？}
{166}{}{我在找坦蒂，能帮我吗？}
{167}{}{呜}
{168}{}{啊？什么东西？太“好”了，我被一个只会呜呜叫的牲口吵起来，你晚上不睡觉吗？明早再来。}
{169}{}{你受伤了？}
{170}{}{对。}
{171}{}{不。}
{172}{}{你很快就会受伤了，如果你老是让我不得安寝的话。快离开。}
{173}{}{哦，天！你刚才不早说。}
{174}{}{啊……刚刚……}
{175}{}{你几乎就没事。我建议休息一下，睡个好觉，很快就会自然恢复的。}
{176}{}{你几乎就没伤到，白痴！早上再来！}
{177}{}{啊，那会有点疼。费用25瓶盖。}
{178}{}{好，拿去。}
{179}{}{我的钱不够。}
{180}{}{哦天呐。伤的很重。50瓶盖。}
{181}{}{好，给你。}
{182}{}{我的钱不够。}
{183}{}{你居然还能走！？这伤极其严重。医治好你可需要好好对天祈祷，还得要够运气。当然，还有100瓶盖。}
{184}{}{好，给你。}
{185}{}{我钱不够。}
{186}{}{你钱不够！抱歉，但是你要知道，我的工作原则不允许我提供免费医疗，等钱够了再回来吧。}
{187}{}{你能拿一些东西作交换吗？}
{188}{}{不谢了。}
{189}{}{抱歉，今天不行。}
{190}{}{我怎么会能帮你杀辐射蝎呢？我是医生，不会战斗！你想要人帮助的话，去找亚拉德什，甚至坦蒂都好，或者她的男朋友赛思。反正别找我就行了。}
{191}{}{我需要东西应付它们的毒素。}
{192}{}{如果我有毒素的样本，应该就能做出解药。}
{194}{}{我不这么想，我觉得她是被绑架了。}
{195}{}{也许吧，我去跟其他人谈谈看。}
{196}{}{这需要花点时间。来，躺下，放松。你可能会有轻微的头痛，来，来……}
{197}{}{我已经尽量帮你了，自求多福吧。}
{300}{}{因为帮忙制作出了解药，你得到250点经验。}
{301}{}{可以吗？}
{302}{}{}
{303}{}{蝎子？蝎子？}
{304}{}{给我的？}
{305}{}{换做辐射蝎尾巴怎么样？}
{306}{}{让我看看！没错，有了这我就能干点有用的事情了。当然也会给你治疗作为报答。}
{307}{}{这要花点时间。我做事的时候你平躺放松。你可能会有轻微的头痛，来来……}
{308}{}{请别拿我的东西。}

{1099}{}{?}
{1199}{}{我可以告诉你：Khans-可汗帮、Garl-伽尔、Junktown-迦克镇、Shady-沙荫镇、Hub-哈勃、Water-水、Tandi-坦蒂、Aradesh-亚拉德什、Seth-赛思、Razlo-拉斯洛、Sands-沙荫镇。}

{1101}{}{他以武力服众，纠集可汗帮。瞄上沙阴镇的人中，他算是最有威胁的一个。}
{1102}{}{往西南走4～6天的路程就到了。偶尔做点交易还不错，不过通常他们都会坑人。}
{1103}{}{你正站在这地方上。}
{1104}{}{在比迦克镇远很多的南边。哈勃城是我听说过的最大的城市。那里至少有几千人。}
{1105}{}{抱歉，这我不清楚。}
{1106}{}{她是亚拉德什的女儿。将来她会领导我们的，但她得学会如何锻炼自己。}
{1107}{}{他是这社区的领袖，真正的英雄。你会发现他总是在城镇大厅工作。}

{1109}{}{那就是我。我是沙荫镇的医生。}
{1110}{}{你就站在这地方上。}
