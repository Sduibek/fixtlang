#{100}{}{You see a big, strong, burly man.}
#{101}{}{Didn't we just meet? Have you come to kill me?}
#{102}{}{I know fathers aren't supposed to hug their sons, but I love you, dad!}
#{103}{}{Master, was this what I was supposed to become, Master?}
#{104}{}{There ain't nothin' like a Dane..}
#{105}{}{What's your favorite color, friend? Mine is milk!}
#{106}{}{You're an idiot, Dane. They're going to kill you soon and you deserve it! Weakling! #Weakling!}
#{107}{}{Mother, did you think they'd drop a bomb?}
#{108}{}{They did it with grace and such aplomb!}
#{109}{}{My name is Dane, it is not Tom!}
{100}{}{你看到一个高大强壮的男人。}
{101}{}{我们这不是碰巧遇见把？你不会是来杀我的吧？}
{102}{}{我知道，虽然父亲不会主动拥抱自己的儿子，但是我爱你，爸爸！}
{103}{}{主教，这就是我应该成为的？主教？}
{104}{}{不是没人喜欢达恩……}
{105}{}{朋友你最喜欢什么颜色？我喜欢牛奶的颜色！}
{106}{}{你是个白痴，达恩。他们不久就来杀你，你活该！窝囊废！窝囊废！}
{107}{}{妈妈，你认为他们会扔下一个炸弹吗？}
{108}{}{他们会幽雅而沉着的去做的！}
{109}{}{我的名字是达恩，不是汤姆！}
#{110}{}{Your poetry sucks, man! It sucks! Sucks! Sucks!}
#{111}{}{I like Mr. Handy! I want to have sex with his cute little hands . . .}
#{112}{}{I'm crazy. I've gone crazy. Oh my god, I have gone completely nuts! Think about peace! Think #about Unity!}

#{119}{}{You know, I once overheard Morpheus shaking his fist at Nightkin. Or did I smell it?}
#{120}{}{You're fools to cry for me. Never cry over spilled milk . . . or damaged goods.}
#{121}{}{Does anyone know how to fix a toaster?}
{110}{}{你真他妈有诗意！哥们！真烂！烂！烂！}
{111}{}{我喜欢汉迪先生！我想要和他可爱的小嫩手干……}

{118}{}{【走调的歌声】曾经，我迷失了自己，但是现在我觉醒啦！我现在已经大彻大悟了！}
{119}{}{你知道吗？我有次偷听到梦神墨菲斯朝夜行团挥动他的拳头。不，不，也没准是我闻到的？}
{120}{}{你们这些白痴就知道对我哭喊，怎么不对那些烂牛奶和破工具哭去？}
{121}{}{有人会修烤箱吗？}
#{122}{}{Of course they do, idiot! It's your head they can't fix, you son of a bitch!}
#{123}{}{It's the guns, you asshole! Gunpowder is intelligent and evil and controls your brain! The #more gunpowder that's near you, the crazier you become! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!}
#{124}{}{ . . . I just want to set the world on fiiiiiiiyaaah!!!}
#{125}{}{You wanna rassle? I used to be real good at it . . . until the Nightkin beat me. Took two of #them, though. Nightkin are real strong!}
#{126}{}{They're mutants, you fool! Of course they're strong!}
{122}{}{他们当然可以，傻瓜！可惜他们不能修理你的头，狗杂种！}
{123}{}{它是枪！你这个屁眼儿！火药可是又坏又狡猾的东西，它们还能控制你的想法！你身边火药越多，你就越疯！然后你就轰！轰！轰！}
{124}{}{……我不过就是想做点惊天动地的事情，哇哈哈哈哈！！！}
{125}{}{你想摔角？我以前可是个高手…直到夜行团打败了我，我就收山了，虽然他们两个一起对付我，不过夜行团确实很壮！}
#{127}{}{So are penguins. And gyro buffalo. They shoot them out of great big bison guns. You gotta #watch out for those buffalo women. They'll drop a bison on you so fast, you won't know what hit you! #Ha!}
#{128}{}{Don't I know you from somewhere? Does your brain hurt, too?}
#{129}{}{Of course you know him, Dane, you idiot! He's our enemy! He must be destroyed!}
#{529}{}{Of course you know her, Dane, you idiot! She's our enemy! She must be destroyed!}
#{130}{}{Don't mind him, he's an asshole. I love you. Do you love me?}
#{131}{}{I used to live in Penticton, British Columbia. Or maybe I saw it on a map of the old days. #Those were good old days. Wish I'd been alive back then . . .}
#{132}{}{Aren't you tired of talking with me? Hasn't this just been incredibly tedious?}
#{133}{}{Aren't you tired of talking with yourself, you schizo bastard?}
#{134}{}{I hate myself. I want to die, but you're counting on me. Counting on me to say something #that makes all of my bullshit mean something! Something important!}
#{135}{}{Why can't I be the important one for a change?}
#{136}{}{MOOOOOO! MOOOOOOO! MOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOOO!}
#{137}{}{MOOOOOO! MOOOOOOO! MOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOOO!}
{126}{}{他们是变种人！你个白痴！当然会很强壮！}
{127}{}{还有企鹅和旋脚水牛！！而且他们用粗大的野牛枪对射。你要提防着点那些女野牛，他们会很快的丢下男野牛去对付你，那么快，到时候你都都不知道谁撞得你，哈！}
{128}{}{我在什么地方见过你？你脑子也撞过墙了？}
{129}{}{你当然见过他，达恩，你个白痴！他是我们的敌人！他必须被消灭！}
{529}{}{你当然见过她，达恩，你个白痴！她是我们的敌人！她必须被消灭！}
{130}{}{不用在乎他，他是一个屁眼。我爱你。你也爱我吗？}
{131}{}{我以前住在温哥华，大不列颠，哥伦比亚，也许我还能在一张过去的老地图上见到它。过去真美好。我希望还能回去……}
{132}{}{你和我说话不累吗？不觉得很无聊吗？}
{133}{}{你和你自己说话不累吗？你个精神分裂的野种。}
{134}{}{我恨我自己，我要死，然而你却在算计我。让我说出那些让我认为他妈很重要的胡话！}
{135}{}{我为什么不能变成一个名人？}
{136}{}{哞哞哞！哞哞哞！哞哞哞！哞哞哞！}
{137}{}{哞哞哞！哞哞哞！哞哞哞！哞哞哞！}
#{138}{}{I'm bored. What's worse, I've been screwed over. It isn't fun anymore. You ever got the #feeling you were just strings and they didn't bother to hang you? I'm all over the floor!}
#{139}{}{MOOOOOO! MOOOOOOO! MOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOOO!}
#{140}{}{Enough with the brahmin! You'll start smelling like them! Then everyone will just puke!}
#{141}{}{I used to be insane, you know, until I went through the Servitor process. I used to be #insane, but now I'm just in pieces. Pieces! Pieces!}
#{142}{}{Son of a bitch, I'm a puzzle! Will you help me put myself together?}
#{143}{}{I can't believe someone's still talking with me . . .}
#{144}{}{It's all a game, you see. A game, and I'm one of the pieces. And a kid got real angry, and #so he started stepping on me. Step and step and step and step, and finally I just broke!}
#{145}{}{Maybe they'll scoop out my brain! Scoop out my brain and turn me into their pet! Here, Dane! #Catch the ball, Dane! Sic 'em, Dane! Sic 'em, Dane! Sic 'em, Dane! Execute them, you brain-dead #dog!}
#{146}{}{Why do you think they call him Master?}
{138}{}{我烦，烦不行吗？我承认我喝多了。真没劲。你曾经有没有这种感觉？你是根儿琴弦，但是却没人弹你？我他妈现在就像块破地板！}
{139}{}{哞哞哞！哞哞哞！哞哞哞！哞哞哞！}
{140}{}{别跟我提双头牛！你闻起来和它们一样！但凡是个人看见你就会呕吐！}
{141}{}{你知道。，我以前一直是个疯子，直到我通过了所有的奴隶程序。我以前就是疯！但是现在，我都碎啦！碎成一片片！一片片！}
{142}{}{我靠！我感到非常混乱！你能帮我安静下来吗？}
{143}{}{我无法信任有些仍和我说话的人……}
{144}{}{所有的一切都是把戏，你知道吗？一出把戏，我不过是其中的一部分。就像一个疯狂的欺骗，一步步的逼近我，一步又一步，一步又一步，一步又一步，最后我崩溃了！}
{145}{}{也许他们会把我的大脑挖出来！挖出我脑子后把我变成他们的宠物！嘿！达恩！接住骨头，达恩！咬他们，达恩！咬他们，达恩！上啊！咬他们，达恩！把他们全咬死！你这只吃屎的笨狗！}
{146}{}{你知道别人为什么称呼他主教吗？}
{147}{}{活着很H蛋，可是死了更H蛋，可惜我不能回到出生那一刻，不让我生下来就一了百了。所以这是重点吗？}
#{147}{}{Life sucks, but death sucks worse, and we can't go back in time to stop our birth, so what's
#the point?}
#{148}{}{I think they get the point, asshole! They know the Servitor process screws you! They know
#this 'baptism machine' just messes . . .}
#{149}{}{My name is Dane. I am a Viking. I like ducks. I rape and pillage! Will you rape and pillage
#with me?}
#{150}{}{Oh God! Master, not God! At least I remember my own name. At least I still have that. Most
#of the other failures didn't, before they shot them. Not pretty corpses either. Nightkin target #practice!}
#{151}{}{And then there were the ones who lost their minds completely. I wish they were dead.}
#{152}{}{I think I'll call my first child Fallout. I had a son once, but the radiation ate him in his #mommy's womb.}
{148}{}{我认为们抓住了重点，混蛋！他们会给你制造一套奴隶程序调教你，他们还会为你做“机械化洗礼”什么之类的……}
{149}{}{我的名字叫达恩！我是个海盗。我惭甲佑！我喜患橐掳掠樱∧慊奸淫我吗？你宦奥佑我吗？}
{150}{}{噢上帝！主教，彩乔上帝！至少我还记得我的名字。至少我还有名字。起码大部分废物在被夜行团射击前都没能有名字，夜行团瞄准训练！}
{151}{}{有一些人完全被洗了脑，丢掉了全部神志。我希望他们这样的人有一个死一个。}
{152}{}{我打算为我的第一个孩子取名叫“辐射”。我曾经有个儿子，但是大量的放射线在他妈的子宫中就把他给吃掉了。}
#{153}{}{Asshole! You just laughed! You didn't give a shit about him or his mother before!}
#{154}{}{Mutants can't breed. And we're all going to become mutants! Don't you know what that means! #The world will be sterile! Sterile! Sterile! We won't breed! We'll all die!}
#{155}{}{Stop him! Stop him! Stop him! Somebody make him stop!}
#{156}{}{Master! I shouldn't have said anything. I heard the Nightkin crying and I felt sorry for #it.}
#{157}{}{What is evil? Evil is when good gets completely screwed up! Evil is when brave people can't #be brave anymore! Evil is an anagram of vile! There's got to be a moral standard somewhere!}
#{158}{}{Shut up, asshole! Moral standards! It sure as Hell ain't here!}
#{159}{}{You know, I used to think religion was a noble calling, and maybe it is; but you can't walk #into it blindly, or they'll take control of your brain.}
{153}{}{屁眼！你笑什么！在他和他妈活着的时候，你还连屎都不会拉呢！}
{154}{}{变种人不能生育。而且我们全部都会变成变种人！你根本就不明白我的意思！整个世界都不会生育！不会生育！不会生育！我们不能生育！我们都会死！}
{155}{}{阻止他！阻止他！阻止他！快来人阻止他！}
{156}{}{主教！我什么都不该说！我听到夜行团在嚎哭，我很同情他们。}
{157}{}{什么叫邪恶？当利益和矛盾完全崛起的时刻就会出现邪恶！当勇敢的人不再勇敢的时候就会出现邪恶！邪恶的英文是Evil！倒过来念是VilE也就是卑鄙！邪恶颠倒黑白！邪恶在有的地方已经成为了评判一个道德的标准！}
{158}{}{闭嘴！垃圾！什么道德的标准！这不是地狱是什么！}
{159}{}{你知道吗？我过去一直认为宗教是一个高贵神圣的字眼，也许它是；但你不能盲目地相信它，不然他们将会控制你的大脑。}
#{160}{}{. . . zombies are a disgrace to God, you know.}
#{161}{}{But why does God make people who break so easily?}
#{162}{}{I think I can finally answer some questions now. Sorry it took so long.}
#{163}{}{What's this place used for?}
#{164}{}{Tell me about the Nightkin.}
#{165}{}{What's going on around here?}
#{166}{}{What did they do to you?}
#{167}{}{Who is the Master?}
{160}{}{……你要知道，那些邪教是对神的亵渎。}
{161}{}{但是神为什么把人造的如此脆弱？}
{162}{}{我现在决定回答你的一些问题。抱歉刚才耽误的时间有些长。}
{163}{}{这是什么地方？}
{164}{}{跟我说说关于夜行团的事情。}
{165}{}{附近发生了什么？}
{166}{}{他们对你做了什么？}
{167}{}{谁是主教？}
#{168}{}{Do you want to die? I can put you out of your misery.}
#{169}{}{You sound stupid!}
#{170}{}{This is the baptismal. They make Servitors here. When acolytes have been indoctrinated, they #bring them here and they go through the process. A few of them survive . . .}
#{171}{}{Most lose their minds, but they're still useful. They throw them downstairs, rant at them #about the Master and walk around in a stupor. You've seen the zombies. Great slave labor -- and #soldiers . . .}
#{172}{}{John Brown's body is molderin' in the Grave. John Brown's body is molderin' in the Grave, #John Brown's body is a-molderin' in the Grave, and the Master's screwing us overrrrr . . .}
#{173}{}{Stop that. It's getting real difficult to hold myself together.}
#{174}{}{Tell me about the Nightkin.}
#{175}{}{What's going on around here?}
#{176}{}{What did they do to you?}
#{177}{}{Who is the Master?}
{168}{}{你想要死吗？我能把你从痛苦中解脱。}
{169}{}{你听起来很蠢！}
{170}{}{这是一场洗礼，他们在这里制造奴隶。当人们需要被传授思想的时候，就把他们经过加工带到这里。他们只有少数的人才能生还……}
{171}{}{大部分人失去了他们的思想，但是他们仍然有用。他们把他们扔到楼下。在昏迷中他们大声喊着主教的名字，恍惚的转着圈。你看到的是僵尸，伟大的奴隶苦工――还有士兵……}
{172}{}{约翰布朗的尸体在坟墓中腐烂了。约翰布朗的尸体在坟墓中腐烂了，约翰布朗的尸体在坟墓中腐烂了，主教把我们全都给操了……}
{173}{}{别说了，我要保持镇静真是太困难了。}
{174}{}{跟我说说关于隐行人的事情。}
{175}{}{附近发生了什么？}
{176}{}{他们对你做了什么？}
{177}{}{谁是主教？}
#{178}{}{Do you want to die? I can put you out of your misery.}
#{179}{}{Ooops! I can't keep myself together anymore! Whee! Whee! Whee!}
#{180}{}{They're mutants. I've heard them talk. I'm very sneaky. I know all their secrets. They hate #me. Hate me very much.}
#{181}{}{I'm screwed, but this is only Phase 1 of the Cathedral Screwover Plan. When servitors get #completely brainwashed, they got to Phase 2. That's when the Master baptizes them in the FEV-2!}
#{182}{}{Most die right there. But those who survive become mutants. BIG mutants. Nightkin! The #Master thinks that only the Nightkin can survive. He wants to make everyone Nightkin because they're #tough!}
#{183}{}{You know all this peace and unity bullshit? It really isn't bullshit to the Master. He #really thinks that he's saving the world!}
#{184}{}{Sterile! We're all going to be hideous, sterile freaks! Sterile! Sterile! Sterile! My name's #not Errol! Sterile!}
#{185}{}{Tell me about the Nightkin.}
#{186}{}{What's going on around here?}
#{187}{}{What did they do to you?}
#{188}{}{Who is the Master?}
#{189}{}{Do you want to die? I can put you out of your misery.}
#{190}{}{MOOOO! MOOOOO! MOOOO! Brahmin Nightkin, coming through! Here comes some sterile milk!}
#{191}{}{The end of the world as we know it. Mutant armies in the Vault, don't blame me, it's the #Master's fault. When we have Unity, that's when the Master's fun REALLY begins.}
#{192}{}{Tell me about the Nightkin.}
#{193}{}{What kind of fun?}
#{194}{}{What did they do to you?}
#{195}{}{Who is the Master?}
{178}{}{你想要死吗？我能从痛苦里解脱你。}
{179}{}{嗷！嗷！我已经无法控制自己的情绪拉！哇！哇！哇！}
{180}{}{他们是变种人。我偷听过他们的谈话。我隐藏的非常好！我知道他们所有的秘密。他们恨我。非常恨我。}
{181}{}{我们被奴役，但这仅仅是大教堂最终奴役计划的第一阶段。当侍从们完成洗脑后，他们开始计划的第二阶段，主教会让他们在FEV－2中完成洗礼仪式。}
{182}{}{大部分人会死在那，但是幸存的人都变成了变种人。巨大的变种人。夜行团！主教认为只有夜行团才能活下来。他想让每个人都变成夜行团，因为夜行团既凶恶又强悍！}
{183}{}{你是不是认为和平与同一是胡扯？对于主教来说它真的不是胡扯。他确实认为他正在解救世界！}
{184}{}{不能生育！我们全都会变的相貌丑恶的畸形人，不育的畸形人！不能生育！不能生育！不能生育！我的名字叫“布-玉”――不能生育！}
{185}{}{和我说说关于夜行团的事情。}
{186}{}{附近发生了什么？}
{187}{}{他们对你做了些什么？}
{188}{}{谁是主教？}
{189}{}{你想死吗？我可以很快让你摆脱痛苦。}
{190}{}{哞哞！哞哞！哞哞！双头牛夜行团到此一游！送给大家一些不育的牛奶……}
{191}{}{我们都听说过世界末日把？变种人军队在避难所里，不要怪我，都是主教的错。当我们“同一”的时候，就是主教那些玩笑真正开始的时候。}
{192}{}{和我说说关于夜行团的事情。}
{193}{}{什么类型的玩笑？}
{194}{}{他们对你做了些什么？}
{195}{}{谁是主教？}
{196}{}{你想死吗？我可以很快让你摆脱痛苦。}
#{196}{}{Do you want to die? I can put you out of your misery.}
#{197}{}{Ooops! I can't keep myself together anymore! Whee! Whee! Whee!}
#{198}{}{Dumped me in chemicals, filled me full of holes, played loud noises for me. That sort of #shit. Tried to make me into something I'm not. Parents do that all the time.}
#{199}{}{I hurt real bad.}
#{200}{}{What's this place used for?}
#{201}{}{Tell me about the Nightkin.}
#{202}{}{What's going on around here?}
#{203}{}{Who is the Master?}
#{204}{}{Do you want to die? I can put you out of your misery.}
#{205}{}{You sound stupid!}
#{206}{}{I used to hurt people bad, too. I was a stud! Hell, I
#was a god! A tough god son of a bitch! But it wasn't enough!
#I was a goose-stepping fighting machine! But now I'm . . . I'm . . . help me . . .}

{198}{}{我被泡在化学药水里啦！我身上的毛孔都要灌满啦！欢呼吧！为我大叫吧！这真是屎！要把努力把我变成本来不是我的东西！可是我父母们经常那么做！}
{199}{}{我伤得太深了。}
{200}{}{这个地方是作什么用的？}
{201}{}{告诉我关于夜行团的事情。}
{202}{}{附近发生了什么？}
{203}{}{主教是谁？}
{204}{}{听说你想死？我可以很快让你摆脱痛苦。}
{205}{}{听起来真蠢！}
{206}{}{我也经常疯狂伤害别人。我就是一个大头针！操的，我是一个神！一个被王八操过的牛逼神！但那还不够！我还是一个迈着企鹅步伐的战斗机器！不过现在，我是……我是……救救我……}
{207}{}{你知道吗？夜行团说他是个比他们还丑的丑八怪。那就是说着他必须要成为一个超级杂种丑八怪。}
{208}{}{他是一个人！一个有计划的人！他爱我们所以制定了许多计划！而且如果这个世界与他的方式合拍，操他！这一切都是那爱带来的！}

#{214}{}{You sound stupid!}

#{216}{}{Where is your conscience, man? Do you think that life's supposed to be some pretty picture #without any misery in it? Life IS misery! Misery, and whatever the Hell we decide to do about it!}

#{219}{}{That is life, man! It's like being drunk; look at it one way, and it's a piss poor #embarrassment! Look at it a different way and it feels great! But it's all the same thing! It's all #life!}
