{100}{}{To krzepki ³owca nagród, nosz¹cy znaczek o treœci "Ja jestem Christopher, a ty œcierwo".}
# Bounty Hunter is considered Male term

{101}{}{Czego chcesz?}
{102}{}{A doughnut.}
{103}{}{Co tu robisz?}
{104}{}{Tylko siê rozgl¹dam.}
{105}{}{Nic.}
{106}{}{Nie przepadamy tu za m¹dralami. Spierdalaj.}
# Alternate for "Buzz off" could be "Get lost" or "Get out of here"

{107}{}{Ten ¿art nie by³ œmieszny nawet za pierwszym razem. Zaraz odkryjesz, czemu jestem jednym z najbardziej przera¿aj¹cych ³owców nagród na Pustkowiu. A nawet nikt mi za to nie zap³aci.}
{108}{}{Nie twoja sprawa.}
{109}{}{Có¿, idŸ szperaæ gdzieœ indziej.}
# Alternate for "poke around" could be "Look around"

{110}{}{Did you know that there's a bounty of }

# Children is considered male plural

{111}{}{(He looks you over, carefully, considering something. It seems he's made a decision already.) Tell me, how often do you visit the Hub or Junktown?}
{112}{}{Often enough, why do you ask?}
{113}{}{Well, you see... business takes almost all of my time and I don't have an opportunity to get there. And as an incurable smoker I miss an old Zippo lighter very much. It's said, many of those pre-War items can be found in the shops there. If you get a Zippo for me, I'll share some information about the neighboring settlements. I think it could be of use!}
{114}{}{It's a pity. Looks like I made a mistake about you. Get out of here.}
{115}{}{Sure, why not? I'll get one for you.}
{116}{}{Okay.}
{117}{}{Hey, I have one right here. I don't really need it and can give it to you in exchange for the information.}
{118}{}{Thank you! (He takes the lighter.) So, what do you want to hear, exactly?}
{119}{}{Here is your lighter. Time to give me some information.}
{120}{}{No more questions, thanks.}
{121}{}{[More]}
{122}{}{What else do you want to know?}
{123}{}{I need some information.}
{124}{}{Buuhhh.. Wuh?}
{125}{}{Are you serious? Get out of my sight.}
{126}{}{I'm going to do the world a favor by putting a bullet through your skull.}
