{100}{}{You see the Elder.}
{101}{}{I am pleased to meet you. I hope you have found this little village pleasing so far.}
{102}{}{Yes.}
{103}{}{Nope, not enough action around here.}
{104}{}{Excellent. I have a favor to ask of you. I promise that you will be well-rewarded for your services to this community.}
{105}{}{Tell me more...}
{106}{}{This is just a demo, but perhaps you will like what I have to say next.}
{107}{}{I'm all ears...}
{108}{}{We have been plagued by Rad Scorpions for some time now. All who have been sent to destroy these monsters have not returned. I will give you weapons and armor if you will follow my guide to their lair and kill them all.}
{109}{}{Sounds good.}
{110}{}{No thanks.}
{111}{}{That is a shame. Please leave.}
{112}{}{Excellent. Sammy here will guide you to the lair. Take these items - they will come in useful. }
{113}{}{Please help us as soon as possible. Time is wasting.}
{114}{}{I don't talk to your kind, stranger.}
