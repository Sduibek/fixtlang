  Not as a dead body only.

Useless fixes (for possible future mods):
- Experience gain is reported for beating Zax at chess. Also cannot repeatedly
  access the mainframe for unlimited experience.

Engine bugs, can't be fixed by now:
- Cheating with the 'A' key.
- Died of radiation sickness for no apparent reason while resting in the
  Brotherhood.
- Playing chess with Zax (checks don't generate criticals).
- Caravans: Going back and forth will take 2-3 days from the time limit, but
  may take up to 20 days as measured; 
- Necropolis: Going to the Military Base takes 2 weeks according to the time limit
  and 4 weeks according to the calendar.
- MacRae is supposed to give you +1 Melee Damage and +5% Damage Resistance,
  but he doesn't (engine disallows modifying derived stats from scripts).

  attack "unprovoked".
- "Bag bug": items disappearing, incorrect quest items checking and removing.

Hardware-related bugs:
- "Endgame bug": accelerated slideshow, no sound or accelerated sound.
  To fix this bug you have to disable a Hardware Acceleration (use dxdiag).

Most map bugs can't be fixed now (we don't have a normal map editor).

Not bugs:
- Disarm Traps for the Facility: This pops up once you deactivate the robots
  from Zax. There's no way of getting it crossed out. -- It is not bug. Robots
  deactivation turns on laser and gas traps on level 1. If you reactivate
  robots, traps will be deactivated and quest will disappear. It may be
  considered as missed quest.
- IN<4: Although Talus will know if you rescued the prisoner, you can't get
  the reward or the xp unless you get smart. -- Definitely not a bug. Talus
  doesn't tolerate "chem users", his script and dialogue clearly state it.
  So, this cannot be changed in a patch.
- Doctors do not heal fractures and other traumas.
