  crash the game.
- Killing a child in the fisherman or peasant coast encounters will affect your
  Childkiller status now.
- Patrick's stuff no longer goes into Beer bottle or Rock. Also Rocks are no longer
  overlapping.
- Now Patrick correctly talks about the invasion of different towns.

Localization bugs:
- Those fixes are for the Russian language only and neither mentioned nor
  applied here.

Removed incorrect fixes:

Hub:
- After Decker's death his active quests will be crossed out in PIPboy.

Necropolis:
- Now you can talk about the quest with Set at any time.

Engine bugs, can't be fixed by now:
- Cheating with the 'A' key.
- Died of radiation sickness for no apparent reason while resting in the
  Brotherhood.
- Playing chess with Zax (checks don't generate criticals).
- Caravans: Going back and forth will take 2-3 days from the time limit, but
  may take up to 20 days as measured; 
- Necropolis: Going to the Military Base takes 2 weeks according to the time limit
  and 4 weeks according to the calendar.
- MacRae is supposed to give you +1 Melee Damage and +5% Damage Resistance,
  but he doesn't (engine disallows modifying derived stats from scripts).
- Saving the game near an irritable person and loading can cause them to
  attack "unprovoked".

Most map bugs can't be fixed now (we don't have a normal map editor).

Not bugs:
- Disarm Traps for the Facility: This pops up once you deactivate the robots
  from Zax. There's no way of getting it crossed out. -- It is not bug. Robots
  deactivation turns on laser and gas traps on level 1. If you reactivate
  robots, traps will be deactivated and quest will disappear. It may be
  considered as missed quest.
- IN<4: Although Talus will know if you rescued the prisoner, you can't get
  the reward or the xp unless you get smart. -- Definitely not a bug. Talus
  doesn't tolerate "chem users", his script and dialogue clearly state it.
  So, this cannot be changed in a patch.



----------------------------------------
(4.0) POPRAWKI DO POLSKIEJ WERSJI PATCHA
----------------------------------------
ver 1.3.4
- Do³¹czony do patcha plik sfall.ini (odpowiednio skonfigurowany, tylko pod WinXP) 
  oraz ddraw.dll (wersja sfall 1.18e) od Timeslipa, programik ten pozwala na 
  uruchomienie gry pod WinXP bez pojawiania siê zaciemniania ekranu w czasie 
  gry utrudniajacego rozgrywkê (poczytaj pkt 4.1).

- Poprawi³em skrypt Iana - w skryptach pochodz¹cych z patcha TeamX by³ b³¹d,
  który uniemo¿liwia³ pojawianie siê komentarzy Iana w Krypcie 13 oraz przed 
  sklepem Killiana a tak¿e w innych lokacjach.

- Zmieni³em wpisy w pliku proto.msg, który nie dzia³a³ poprawnie z angielsk¹ 
  wersj¹ pliku falloutw.exe za³¹czonym do patcha. B³¹d objawia³ siê obcinaniem
  tEkstów wyœwietlanych w lewym dolnym okienku opisuj¹cych stan obserwowanych 
  postaci (poczytaj pkt 4.1).

- Poprawi³em dialog Tandi, zapytana o Razlo podawa³a z³e namiary.



ver 1.3.3
- Poprawi³em tekst odpowiedzi Aradesha na pytanie o Razlo zadane 
  w "Powiedz mi o...". Aradesh teraz wskazuje poprawny kierunek strony œwiata,
  gdzie mo¿e znajdowaæ siê Razlo.

- Poprawi³em b³êdy w jednym z tzw. splash screenów z polskiej wersji Fallout1 
  z Sagi Falloutów.

- Poprawi³em b³êdy w spolszczeniu z wersji 1.3.1 PL.


------------------------------
(4.1) PROBLEMY Z GR¥ POD WinXP
------------------------------

Zacytujê tu (z ma³ymi modyfiakcjami) swoj¹ odpowiedŸ przedastawion¹ na Shamo
( http://shamo.gry-online.pl/agora/index.php?showtopic=3973 )


Posiadam Fallout 1 z Sagi, czyli w jêzyku polskim w wersji 1.2 z poprawk¹"steal bug fix".
Z instalacj¹ pod WinXP nie mam ¿adnych problemów. Natomiast problem jest podczas gry. 
Nie doœæ ¿e czasem zdarza siê, ¿e gra uruchamia siê koszmarnie d³ugo i ka¿de przejœcie
do kolejnej lokacji trwa równie¿ bardzo d³ugo, to dos³ownie co kilka sekund ca³y ekran
zaciemnia siê uniemo¿liwiaj¹c dalsz¹ grê bez bardzo czêstego poruszania myszk¹ 
(wówczas odkrywa siê fragment obrazu ) albo wogóle odœwie¿enia ekranu poprzez chwilowe 
wejœcie/wyjœcie do menu zapisu gry czy te¿ wywo³anie ekranu pomocy. Po tej operacji po 
kilku sekundach ekran ponownie siê zaciemnia.

I nie pomaga ustawianie w trybów zgodnoœci, ani instalacja najnowszych sterów do karty 
graficznej (mam GF7600), czy instalacja DirectX9c czy jakiekolwiek inne zabiegi.

Pomaga tylko sfall Timeslipa w wersji dla Fallout1 pod WinXP. Ale jest jeden problem. 
Plik "falloutw.exe" pochodz¹cy z Sagi jest niekompatybilny z sfall-em. Mo¿na jednak to omin¹æ,
instaluj¹c plik "falloutw.exe" pochodz¹cy z amerykañskiej wersji Fallout1 ale w wersji 1.2 
(najlepiej ten z patcha TeamX-a z wersji 1.2).
Korzystaj¹c z tej porady trzeba tylko w pliku ddraw.ini w [Graphics] ustawiæ opcjê Mode=4 
i potem mo¿na odpalaæ grê i cieszyæ siê p³ynnie dzia³aj¹c¹ gr¹. Jednak coœ za coœ, filmiki bêd¹
siê trochê zamazywaæ, ale to chyba da siê prze¿yæ, no nie? Wa¿ne, ¿e mo¿na normalnie graæ.

I jeszcze jeden ma³y drobiazg, ale te¿ upierdliwy.
Po zastosowaniu tych zabiegów, podczas grania, gdy zechcemy sobie sprawdziæ stan obserwowanej 
postaci (swojej czy te¿ przeciwnika), to teksty wyœwietlane w lewym dolnym okienku 
(tzw display) bêd¹ obcinane, np.:


tekst brzmi     "Wygl¹da na istotê, która"
a powinno byæ   "Wygl¹da na istotê, która jest w pe³ni si³" itp

Ten b³¹d (jak te¿ kilka innych) zosta³ wyeliminowany w patchu w wersji 1.3.4 PL i wy¿szej.



Czyli inaczej mówi¹c w patchu 1.34PL wyeliminowa³em wy¿ej opisany b³¹d z b³êdnym wyœwietlaniem 
niektórych tekstów w polskiej wersji gry przy zastosowaniu pliku "exe" z wersji angielskiej.
  
Taki b³¹d pojawi siê, gdy u¿yje siê angielskiej wersji pliku "exe" w FO1 na polskim Falloucie. 
Sens uzywania angielskiego pliku na polskiej grze jest taki, ¿e dzia³a on pod sfall-em, 
który to znowu likwiduje upierdliwe zamazywanie ekranu na czarno podczas gry, 
a polska wersja pliku "exe" jest z sfall niekompatybilna (gra siê nie odpali).





--------------------------
(5.0) INFORMACJE DODATKOWE
--------------------------
A.Ten patch zawiera równie¿ polsk¹ poprawkê tzw. "Steal Bug", która wprowadza 
  nastêpuj¹ce zmiany:
- Skrócone teksty opisów kradzie¿y, które powodowa³y zawieszanie siê gry.
- Zmienione czcionki, gdy¿ stare destabilizowa³y system, co dawa³o efekt 
  losowego zawieszania siê gry.

B.Do archiwum polskiej wersji patcha do³¹czony jest plik "readme13.txt" 
  pochodz¹cy z wersji angielskiej.

C.Autorem patcha jest TeamX ( www.teamx.ru ).

D.Autorem "sfall" jest Timeslip ( http://timeslip.chorrol.com/sfall.html )

E.T³umaczenia i poprawek do polskiej wersji dokona³ Cubik 
  (FMC, Shamo Community), ( http://www.newfmc.prv.pl/ ).

F.Podziêkowania dla Tailsa ( OUTPOST - http://postapocalyptic.net/ ) za wykrycie 
  i zg³oszenie kilku b³êdów w poprzedniej wersji patcha (1.3.3PL) - (skrypt Iana).





¯yczê przyjemnej gry!
